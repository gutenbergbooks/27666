<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Seek and Find</span>" is the third of the serial stories published
in "<span class="smcap">Our Boys and Girls</span>," where it appeared as the
sequel of "<span class="smcap">Breaking Away</span>." The author had no more
reason to complain of its reception than of that accorded to
its predecessors; and he returns his sincere thanks to all those
young friends who have written hundreds of letters to him,
containing the most generous commendation, with an occasional
criticism, which was by no means unwelcome.</p>

<p>Ernest Thornton is a smart boy&mdash;perhaps he is too smart;
but his smartness is not worldly cunning; it is made up of
those elements of character which constitute a noble and true
man&mdash;good judgment, quick perception, and manly decision,
mingled with those moral and religious attributes which
are the leading springs of the true life. If some of the hero's
actions are doubtful, his motives are always good. The greatest
crime against the moral law is to be without a high aim;
and while a thousand errors and short-comings may be forgiven,
the want of a good intention is the capital sin which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
may not be pardoned. While we cannot ask or expect all
young men to accomplish what Ernest Thornton did, we may
point to his high aims and good intentions, and say to the
reader, "Go thou and do likewise."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST THORNTON BECOMES ACQUAINTED
WITH MISS KATE LORAINE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WE are getting a capital breeze over here," said
my friend Bob Hale, who was seated at my
side in the Splash.</div>

<p>"There is always plenty of wind over here when it
comes from the north-west," I replied.</p>

<p>It was one of the last days of May, and the weather,
which had been chilly and disagreeable during the
preceding week, was warm and pleasant. I had been
to school, as usual, in my boat, and was taking Bob
out for a sail, intending to land him at Parkville before
dark, and return to the cottage of my uncle beyond
the town. I had made one long stretch with the wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
on the beam, nearly over to Cannondale; in fact, the
water was beginning to shoal off the point half a mile
to the northward and eastward of that town.</p>

<p>Along the shore of the lake for two or three miles,
on each side of Cannondale, were many beautiful residences,
occupied by wealthy people, who were attracted
to the locality by the pleasant but not picturesque
scenery. It was a delightful region for a summer sojourn,
though many of the people were permanent
residents.</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, we must come about or get aground,"
I continued. "Where shall we go now?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere you please, Ernest. I enjoy sailing
wherever you go, though I like running along the
shore, where you can enjoy these fine gardens, and
occasionally look in upon a pleasant party, especially
if they happen to be singing, or playing a lively game."</p>

<p>"That's just my idea; and we will follow the shore
round to Parkville. The wind will favor us all the
way."</p>

<p>I put the Splash about, and with the wind on the
quarter, laid a course which kept the boat within a few
rods of the shore. From the beach in the rear of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
many of the houses, little piers, not more than three
or four feet wide, were extended into the lake, for the
convenience of embarking and landing in the boats,
with which nearly every dwelling was supplied. We
were approaching one of these piers belonging to the
first house beyond the Point, when Bob and myself
were startled by a shrill scream, which caused both of
us to spring to our feet.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" demanded Bob.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I can't see anything," I replied.</p>

<p>"Is it somebody overboard?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any one. It came from the garden beyond
that first pier."</p>

<p>"There it is again," said Bob, greatly excited, as
the scream was repeated.</p>

<p>We were not long left in doubt in regard to the
person who had uttered the cry; for a girl immediately
emerged from the foliage of the garden, and ran
down to the end of the pier, where she paused and
looked timorously behind her. We looked anxiously
for the cause of her terror, almost expecting to see a
bear, a wolf, or at least a savage dog, in pursuit of the
hapless maiden. The young lady was nicely dressed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and seemed to be fourteen years of age. Of course
Bob and I were both willing "to do or die" in her
defence, though we were just then rather too far off
to be of instant service to her, even if any savage
beast had assailed her.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with her?" said Bob; "she
appears to be frightened out of her wits."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything to alarm her."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>But then the young lady screamed again, and we
saw a lady rushing out to the place where the girl
was, at the end of the pier. The latter seemed to be
fearfully agitated; and giving one more agonizing cry,
she leaped into the lake, just as the lady was on the
point of seizing her by the arm.</p>

<p>Bob and I were thrilled to the depths of our being
by this exciting scene. I had already put the helm
up, and the Splash was headed directly towards the
young lady, who was struggling in the water. The
wind carried her away from the pier about twenty
feet, when the Splash reached the place, and I ran
her between the girl and the shore.</p>

<p>"Save her! save her!" cried the lady on the pier.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i001.jpg" width="500" height="397" alt="THE EXCITING SCENE ON THE SOUTH SHORE.&mdash;Page 14." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE EXCITING SCENE ON THE SOUTH SHORE.&mdash;Page 14.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take the helm, Bob," shouted I, throwing the boat
round into the wind, and springing upon the half deck.</p>

<p>I was prepared to jump overboard, if it was necessary;
but it was not. I had seized the short boat-hook
as I went forward, and with it I hooked on to
her dress. Drawing her towards the boat, I seized
her by the arm, and lifted her on board. She had
been in the water but a few moments, and had not
lost her consciousness; indeed, she appeared not to
have suffered at all from her bath. I at once concluded
that she was one of the young ladies whom I
had frequently seen bathing on the beach, and that
the water had no terrors to her. I had not seen her
swim, though the water was over her head.</p>

<p>I placed her on one of the seats as soon as I had
pulled her out of the water, expecting her to faint, or
do some other womanish thing. She brushed the
water from her eyes, and bending down so that she
could look under the foresail, she caught a glimpse of
the lady on the pier.</p>

<p>"Take me away from here&mdash;O, do!" said she, bestowing
a pleading look upon me.</p>

<p>"Where shall I land you?" I asked, in gentle
tones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anywhere but here&mdash;don't leave me here," she
replied, earnestly, and hardly less agitated than when
she had leaped into the lake.</p>

<p>"But you are wet through, and you may take cold,"
I suggested, mildly.</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do. It makes no difference. Take
me away from here."</p>

<p>"Where shall I land you?" I asked again, puzzled
by her singular conduct.</p>

<p>"I don't care where; but if you land me here I
shall jump into the lake again."</p>

<p>Bob Hale had put the helm up, and the Splash
had filled away again on her former course, which
was bearing us away from the pier on which the lady
still stood.</p>

<p>"Shall I come about?" asked he, apparently satisfied
that the only thing we could do was to land the
young lady on the pier.</p>

<p>"Not just yet, Bob," I replied, fearful that a change
of our course would increase her agitation.</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you for what you
have done for me," said the dripping maiden, who
paid not the slightest attention to the condition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
her clothing, and was wholly absorbed in her own
thoughts, which were painful enough to give her face
an expression of agony. "I hope you will not think
I am ungrateful, Ernest Thornton."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," I replied, astonished to find
she knew my name.</p>

<p>"And I shall be ever so much more grateful to you
if you will take me away from this place," she added,
with a beseeching look.</p>

<p>"I really don't know what to do. You called me
by name, just now, but I do not remember to have
seen you before."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have not; but I have seen your boat
so often that I feel acquainted with you."</p>

<p>"May I ask you to tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, but you will not know me any
better. It is Kate Loraine," she replied, more calmly
than she had yet spoken.</p>

<p>I was certainly no wiser for what she told me,
though I knew that Loraine was the name of the people
who lived in the house nearest to the Point.</p>

<p>"Who is the lady on the pier?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Loraine," answered she, with a visible shudder;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
though I could not tell whether it was caused
by the mention of the lady's name, or by the cold
chill of her wet condition.</p>

<p>"Is she your mother?" I continued; and it seemed
to me that her answer to this question would enable
me to decide whether or not to land her on the pier.</p>

<p>"No, no!" replied she, with the most decisive emphasis.</p>

<p>"But your names are the same."</p>

<p>"They are; of course she has my father's name."</p>

<p>I could not see why that followed, but I did not
like to carry my questions to the point of impudence.</p>

<p>"Is your father at home?"</p>

<p>"My father is dead," she answered, in a very sad
tone.</p>

<p>"Excuse me if I ask who the lady is that stands
on the pier."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Loraine."</p>

<p>"And not your mother?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"You seemed to be running away from her when
I heard you screaming."</p>

<p>"I was; she was trying to catch me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps Miss Kate Loraine thought I was very obtuse,
but I could not understand the relation between
the parties, and I had not the faintest idea why she
was running away from Mrs. Loraine. I was not
willing to believe that a young miss like her intended
to resort to such a desperate remedy as suicide for
any real or imaginary sufferings.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Bob?" I asked, turning to my
companion, completely nonplussed by the circumstances.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do. It seems to me we
ought to return the young lady to her friends," replied
he.</p>

<p>"I have no friends," interposed Kate, and the tears
started in her eyes; "at least I have none in Cannondale."</p>

<p>"Don't you live at Mrs. Loraine's?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I shall live there no longer."</p>

<p>"You say she is not your mother?" I added, returning
to the point I had twice left.</p>

<p>"She was my father's wife, but she is not my
mother."</p>

<p>"She is your step-mother," I continued, as the light
flooded my dull brain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is; I do not wish to speak ill of her, but I
do wish to keep away from her. She is not kind to
me, to say the very least."</p>

<p>I pitied her, and I saw by Bob's looks that he was
not at all behind me in the outflow of his sympathy.
I had read stories enough about "awful step-mothers"
to form an idea of Kate's situation, though I had no
prejudices against step-mothers, as such. Bob Hale's
father had married a second wife, but Bob and his
sister would never have known from her treatment of
them, that she was not their own mother.</p>

<p>If Kate was not a very pretty girl, she was certainly
a very interesting one. Her form was grace itself, but
her eyes were all that was pretty about her face; and
when I looked at her I was not willing to believe it
possible that any one, and especially one bearing her
father's name, could ill-treat her.</p>

<p>By this time the boat had gone to the farther corner
of the lake, and it was necessary to brace her up
or come about. I went aft to take the helm, and Kate
followed me, taking a seat at my side. I put the
tiller hard down, and the Splash came about, heading
towards Cannondale. Our passenger was quick to
discern the course, and became quite excited again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are taking me home again!" exclaimed she.
"O, Ernest Thornton! you will not do that. Let
me land here, anywhere, even on that island, but do
not give me back to her."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do, Miss Loraine; but I
think you ought to have dry clothes at once."</p>

<p>"Have pity upon me, and do not take me home,"
pleaded she.</p>

<p>She was so agitated that I became alarmed; and
to pacify her, I came about again, and steered for
Parkville.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST LISTENS TO THE STORY OF MISS
KATE LORAINE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>FORTUNATELY the day was warm and the
sun shining brightly, or our gentle passenger
must have suffered severely from the effects of her
voluntary bath. I do not know that I ever felt more
embarrassed and perplexed than I did when I sat in
the Splash that day, with Miss Kate Loraine at my
side, her dress hanging "slinky" and dripping upon
her. Certainly there was nothing sentimental in the
affair, for, though I was willing to become a knight
errant in a good cause, the situation was so awkward
that I could not enjoy it.</div>

<p>Bob Hale was as much in trouble as I was, and
he could not tell what to do any better than I could.
Neither of us was willing to assume the responsibility
of taking the young lady from her home on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
strength of her own assertion that her step-mother
abused her. There were two sides to every question,
and with the brighter example of Mrs. Hale before
us, we were not disposed to regard her as a monster
without giving her a hearing.</p>

<p>Kate was quite composed again when she found the
boat was headed towards Parkville, instead of Cannondale.
One thing was very much in her favor; she
was not willing to speak evil of the lady who abused
her. She had told us no more than was necessary to
explain her position. Her demeanor did not indicate
any thing malignant in her heart; on the contrary,
her conduct exhibited a degree of Christian forbearance
which was hardly to be expected of one who
had been abused.</p>

<p>"I have heard all about you, Ernest Thornton,"
said Kate, as the Splash stood over towards Parkville.</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed? I was not aware that I was
celebrated enough to be talked about," I laughingly
replied.</p>

<p>"You are; and ever since you beat the Champion
in the race with the Adieno, I have looked upon you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
as a hero. I have often wished that I might see you
close to."</p>

<p>She was close enough to me now to make me shiver
when I looked at her, she was so wet and drabbled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am a kind of one-horse hero among
the boys," I added, for the sake of saying something.</p>

<p>"And among the girls, too," said she, promptly, if
not boldly, though there was a degree of simplicity
in her manner which prevented me from giving her
words an unfavorable construction. "I have heard
them in Cannondale and Parkville tell what a bold,
brave fellow you are."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to them and to you for
the good opinion of me. If you have confidence in
me, that will answer my present purpose."</p>

<p>She looked curiously at me; and taking advantage
of this favorable current of sentiment, I put the Splash
about on the other tack, so that she was again headed
towards Cannondale. Bob looked anxiously from Kate
to me, and from me to Kate again. He expected another
storm of emotion from her, and so did I; but I
had decided upon my course, and was fully determined
to carry it out, even if it broke the heartstrings of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
fair passenger. I was sorry to be so ungallant as to
resist the will of a young lady, but my conscience
would not let me interfere with the domestic arrangements
of Mrs. Loraine, without giving her a chance to
defend herself.</p>

<p>"They say you are a smart boy, Ernest Thornton,"
added she, apparently without noticing the change in
the course of the boat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am&mdash;I don't know," I replied; "I am
afraid if I take you over to Parkville, people will
think I am smarter than I ever was before."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked she, bestowing a painfully anxious
glance upon me.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be rather smart for Bob
Hale and me to run away with a young lady like
you?"</p>

<p>"Run away with me!" exclaimed she, with a
troubled look.</p>

<p>"What should we do with you after we had landed
you?"</p>

<p>"O, I won't give you any trouble at all&mdash;not a bit."</p>

<p>"We don't mind the trouble, Miss Loraine; we
were only thinking what would become of you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have an uncle in New York city&mdash;my father's
brother. If I can only get to him, it will be all I
want," she answered, and her future course seemed to
be clear enough to her.</p>

<p>"But how will you get to New York?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I would rather walk than stay at
Cannondale any longer."</p>

<p>"Haven't you written to your uncle?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"No; I don't know what his first name is; and
Mrs. Loraine won't let me write any letters. I wrote
one once, and directed it to Mr. Loraine, New York,
but she burnt it up."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could find him?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I could. I would call on every one of
that name in the city. Why, Ernest Thornton!
You are going back to Cannondale!" exclaimed Kate,
as she happened to glance ahead, and saw the shore
not far distant.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Miss Loraine. Just now you
said I was a hero, and a smart boy, and all that sort
of thing. My friend Bob Hale, here, is as smart and
as much of a hero as I am, I assure you. Between
us two we will do what we can for you," I interposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
when she began to exhibit signs of another outbreak
of emotion.</p>

<p>"That's so!" added Bob, decidedly; and he was
always ready to back up any thing I said or did.</p>

<p>"Now keep cool, Miss Loraine," I continued.
"Don't be a bit afraid, and Bob and I will see you
through, if we have to stand on our heads and walk
through fire and water to do it."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, and I am very much obliged
to you," replied she, with a shudder, as she glanced
at the pier, a quarter of a mile off, on which Mrs.
Loraine was still standing. "But don't make me go
there again."</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Loraine, you must be reasonable," said
I, in the gentlest tone I could command, albeit I was
not much accustomed to the refinements of young
ladies' society. "It would not be right for Bob and
me to carry you away from your home. People would
think hard of us."</p>

<p>"Then I don't want you to do it," she replied, in
tones of resignation.</p>

<p>"We don't know any thing about the affairs at
your house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have told you the truth."</p>

<p>"We do not doubt that; but you only say that
Mrs. Loraine is not kind to you."</p>

<p>"She is not."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that she abuses you?"</p>

<p>"I do mean that," replied Kate, with some hesitation,
which evinced an unwillingness to acknowledge
the fact.</p>

<p>"What has she done to you?"</p>

<p>"She locks me up in one of the attic rooms for
weeks together," she replied, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Kate; what does she lock you up for?"
asked Bob, when I paused.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am very naughty, sometimes, but I
can't help it," sobbed she.</p>

<p>"Then she locks you up to punish you for being
naughty&mdash;does she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Bob looked significantly at me, as much as to say
that he did not wish to have anything to do with
"rescuing" a young miss who had been shut up for
being naughty.</p>

<p>"If she would only be kind to me <i>sometimes</i>, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
could bear it all. If she only smiled on me even
once a month, I think I should not complain. But,
O, it is so terrible to be locked into your chamber,
and stay there day after day for a whole week!"
moaned she, with a convulsive quiver.</p>

<p>"When did she lock you up last?" continued Bob,
who had taken the investigation into his own hands,
when Kate showed a willingness to answer.</p>

<p>"About a week ago."</p>

<p>"A week ago? I thought you said she kept you
in your room for a week?"</p>

<p>"So she does, and she only let me out this forenoon."</p>

<p>"What did she lock you up for last time?"</p>

<p>"For taking such long stitches hemming her handkerchief."</p>

<p>"For taking long stitches!" exclaimed Bob, with
something like horror in his tones. "Did she shut
you up for a week for this?"</p>

<p>"She did; and she fastened the blinds of the chamber
so that I could not open them."</p>

<p>"Did you refuse to take short stitches?" I asked,
fearing there might be some aggravating circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I did not, indeed. I hemmed the handkerchief
just as I always did, and I did not think the
stitches were too coarse," she replied, wiping away
her tears with a wet handkerchief. "It was done
just like this one," she added, exhibiting it as a specimen
of her work.</p>

<p>Neither Bob nor myself was sufficiently skilled in
sewing craft to judge of the quality of the work, but
the stitches did not seem to be very long. We compared
the hemming with that on our own handkerchiefs,
but were not able to detect much difference.</p>

<p>"When did Mrs. Loraine shut you up the time
before that," I asked, handing her the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I had not been out three days."</p>

<p>"What was it for that time?"</p>

<p>"Because I pulled up some flowers in the garden
which were just coming up. I thought they were
weeds; and I'm sure I didn't mean any harm."</p>

<p>"How long did she shut you up for this?" asked
Bob.</p>

<p>"Eight days."</p>

<p>"What do you do in your chamber while shut up
there?" I inquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Don't you have books?"</p>

<p>"O, no! If I did, I shouldn't mind it so much."</p>

<p>"Don't you sew?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm not allowed to do anything," she answered,
with a convulsive sob.</p>

<p>I could hardly keep from crying myself, and I was
almost choked by my efforts to keep down my emotions.
I had kept the boat away from the pier, in
order to afford time for this inquiry, and the Splash
was now off the Point. I put her about, and ran
before the wind towards the pier again.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to tell us what the trouble was
to-day, before you jumped into the water?" said
Bob, tenderly.</p>

<p>"She told me to water the flowers in her garden,
and I was doing it. She kept telling me how to do
it, and what to water, and I tried as hard as I could
to please her; but I was so frightened lest I should
do something wrong, that I trod on a peony, and
broke it down. She was very angry, and immediately
told me to go back to my room, and stay there
another week. O, if you only knew how I dreaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that room! If you only knew how gloomy and sad
I am when shut up there! If you could only feel
how long and heavy the hours are there, you would
pity me."</p>

<p>"I do pity you," said Bob, warmly.</p>

<p>"I begged her on my knees not to shut me up.
I felt then that I would rather die than be shut up
again, for I only got out this morning. That's my
room," said she, with a shudder, as she pointed to
an attic window in the rear of the house.</p>

<p>"Miss Loraine, we will stand by you!" I exclaimed,
with enthusiasm, for my feelings had been strongly
worked upon by her story. "But you must go to
the house, and get warm clothing. Bob and I will
go with you."</p>

<p>"But I shall be sent to my room at once."</p>

<p>"If you are, we will get you out this very night,
if we have to lift the roof off the house to do it."</p>

<p>Kate was fearful; but whatever happened, we were
determined that she should have dry clothing. I
ran the Splash up to the pier, where Mrs. Loraine
was impatiently waiting for the boat.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST CALLS UPON MRS. LORAINE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;BEGAN to fear that you did not intend to
return, young gentlemen," said Mrs. Loraine, as
the Splash came up on the leeward side of the pier.
"I am afraid this young lady has given you a great
deal of trouble."</div>

<p>"No trouble at all," I replied.</p>

<p>"She is a wayward and disobedient girl. I have
trouble enough with her, but I do not wish to have
her trouble other people," continued Mrs. Loraine;
and I could see that the glances she bestowed upon
her step-daughter were full of malice.</p>

<p>"She seems to have some trouble herself, or she
wouldn't have jumped into the lake."</p>

<p>"She would not have done that if she hadn't seen
your boat close by," added the lady.</p>

<p>"I fear she will take cold," said I, wishing to draw
the woman out as much as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no danger. She would be in the water
half the time if I would let her. She is a troublesome
girl."</p>

<p>Mrs. Loraine certainly took the matter quite coolly,
and did not seem to realize or to believe that the
troublesome miss had actually jumped into the lake
to escape from her cruelty. She told Kate to get
out of the boat, and go into the house. The terrified
girl obeyed in silence, and with trembling frame.</p>

<p>"Go to your room, and put on dry clothes," she
added, as Kate walked up the pier. "She is a very
naughty girl; but I am much obliged to you, young
gentlemen, for the trouble you have taken on her
account."</p>

<p>"We were very glad to serve her," I replied, fastening
the painter of my boat to a ring in the pier,
as the lady walked towards the house.</p>

<p>Bob and I stepped on shore and followed her&mdash;a
movement which seemed to annoy her very much;
but we were too decidedly in earnest to care what
she thought or felt. Without any consultation with
my companion, I had by this time made up my mind
that Miss Kate had the rights of the case; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Mrs. Loraine was a female tyrant. I did not consider
that her family affairs did not concern me, and
I had already concluded to adopt the policy of intervention,
without regard to consequences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Loraine was a lady, so far as her manners
were concerned. There was nothing coarse or brutal
about her. Like our old enemy, Mr. Parasyte, she
appeared to be a refined tyrant, whose oppression
was all the more intolerable because it was smooth
and polished. The lady walked at a dignified pace
towards the house, and we followed her at a respectful
distance. Occasionally she glanced half round, so
that she could see us, but she did not challenge us
in regard to our intentions.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Ernest?" asked Bob
Hale, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"I hardly know yet. We will follow the matter
up, and when we get a little farther into it we shall
know better what to do," I replied. "I think we
will stop here a while, and let things take their
course."</p>

<p>We halted, and busied ourselves in examining a
parterre of flowers, while the lady continued on her
way, and entered the house at a side door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know about this business," said Bob, when
Mrs. Loraine was no longer within hearing.</p>

<p>"I do," I answered decidedly. "I'm as clear as a
quill in regard to it."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to get the young lady out of the
scrape, by hook or by crook. Since I have seen this
woman, I am satisfied that Miss Kate did not tell
us more than half of the truth."</p>

<p>"What can you do?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as Kate has had time to put on
dry clothes, we will call upon her to inquire for her
health. We can't do any thing less than that, after
we have pulled her out of the lake."</p>

<p>"We can certainly do that, but it seems to me
that is about all we can do."</p>

<p>"I don't know; we will see," I replied, not quite
willing yet to tell my prudent friend what I intended;
not that he would be behind me in carrying out
any good work, but because he was rather fond of
arguing against bold measures.</p>

<p>We waited about half an hour, but we were not
unobserved; for through the Venetian blinds I saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Mrs. Loraine several times in the act of watching
our movements. It was plain enough to me that
we were not welcome visitors, and that the lady was
not a little disturbed by our presence. We went up
to the side door, where she had entered, and rang
the bell. The summons was answered by the servant
girl, who, when we asked to see Mrs. Loraine, invited
us to the sitting-room. I judged that we had unwittingly
chosen an opportune moment for our entrance,
for Kate's persecutor was not in the room, and probably
had not noticed our approach. If she had, it
is very likely she would not have permitted us to
come in.</p>

<p>Through the open door we saw her come down
the stairs. She looked vexed and annoyed when
she discovered who her visitors were, and sailed into
the room with an exhibition of <i>hauteur</i> which might
have produced a strong impression on a couple of
smaller boys than Bob and myself.</p>

<p>"We called to inquire for Miss Kate," I began,
after I had risen from my chair, and made the politest
bow I was capable of making.</p>

<p>"She is quite well," replied Mrs. Loraine, coolly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope she has not suffered from the cold bath
she took in the lake," I continued.</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"She was very much agitated and distressed."</p>

<p>"She will get over that."</p>

<p>"We would like to see her, if you please," I
added, coming to the point without any more parleying.</p>

<p>"It would not be convenient for her to see you
this evening," answered Mrs. Loraine, with more emphasis
than an ordinary case seemed to require.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, for we desire very much to see her;
indeed, we promised to see her after she had changed
her clothes."</p>

<p>"Well, young gentlemen, I will assure her you have
kept your promise, which will be sufficient to relieve
you from any charge of want of fidelity," said she.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Loraine, but if it isn't
too much trouble, we would like very much to see
Miss Kate."</p>

<p>"It would be no trouble at all, but it would be
entirely inconsistent with my purposes to have her
leave her room to-night," answered she, haughtily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"At what hour to-morrow could we see her," I
asked.</p>

<p>"It would not be proper at any hour to-morrow
for you to see her. Kate is a wilful and disobedient
girl, and I find it necessary to permit her to see no
one, in her present frame of mind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought to tell you, Mrs. Loraine, that
Kate very strongly objected to returning to her
home, and begged us to land her any where&mdash;in
the woods&mdash;rather than bring her back to you," I
added.</p>

<p>"Did she, indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Loraine, her
face becoming very red. "Then she is even more
wilful than I supposed."</p>

<p>"It was only by the promise to see her, that we
induced her to land here."</p>

<p>"You behaved very properly in returning her to
me, and I am greatly obliged to you for your consideration.
It is not necessary for me to detail to
you, who are strangers to me, the troubles I experience
in my domestic affairs; and you are too gentlemanly
to wish to pry into them."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but when a young lady becomes so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
desperate as to jump overboard, it seems to me she
must be in a very bad condition."</p>

<p>"That was all a sham. Perhaps I have indulged
her too much, and not begun early enough to subdue
her violent temper. She is very wilful, and needs
stern discipline."</p>

<p>"Do you think it was fair to keep her in a room
a week for taking too long stitches, or for treading
on a flower?"</p>

<p>She looked at me, and turned red again.</p>

<p>"I see that Kate has been indelicate enough to
tell you about our family affairs. Of course you
have sufficient discretion to disbelieve such ridiculous
stories."</p>

<p>"After pulling her out of the lake, we were much
interested in her. We don't wish to interfere, but I
suppose there can be no harm in telling us what
you did shut her up a week or ten days for."</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged to you, young gentlemen,
for what you have done; but I cannot submit to be
called to an account for my conduct in my own
family. I must ask you to excuse me now, for I
have an engagement at this hour."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>It was evident to me that we could find out nothing
about Kate from her; but the look of malignity
she wore on her face when she spoke of her step-daughter
was the best kind of testimony to me. I
rose from my chair, and moved towards the door,
followed by Bob Hale. We bade the lady good
evening, and she closed the door behind us.</p>

<p>Just as we were going down the steps, a buggy,
drawn by two handsome horses, came up to the
door, which assured us that the lady's engagement
was not a pretence used to get rid of us. The
horses were driven by a gayly-dressed gentleman.
When he alighted, and I obtained a fair view of his
face and form, I was considerably interested in him,
for I had seen him before.</p>

<p>It was the gentleman I had seen at the cottage,
with whom my uncle Amos had had some hard
words. He was in some way connected with my
silent guardian, and I was very anxious to know
who and what he was, for such information might
be the key to the mystery which shrouded my existence.
For the moment I forgot all about Kate.</p>

<p>"Come along, Ernest," said Bob, when I paused
to observe the gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go down to the boat, Bob, and I will be with
you in a few minutes."</p>

<p>I stepped into a path where the foliage concealed
me; but I saw the gentleman looking down the
drive-way as if to obtain a second view of me, for
I had observed before that he appeared to recognize
me.</p>

<p>"I will be ready in a moment, Tom," said Mrs.
Loraine, opening the front door.</p>

<p>Tom! He was a constant visitor, or she would
not be thus familiar with him. Who was Tom? I
wished she had called him by his surname. As I
gazed at his face, while he sat in the buggy, I fancied
that it bore some resemblance to that of my
uncle.</p>

<p>This man had a quarrel with my misanthropic
guardian. I had lived at the cottage with uncle
Amos from early childhood. I could faintly remember
a weary waste of waters before I came to Parkville,&mdash;in
which the cottage was located,&mdash;but nothing
more. During the preceding year I had drawn
it out of my uncle that my father was dead, and
my mother an inmate of an insane asylum, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
no property was left for me by my parents. Who
they were, where my father died, or where my mother
was imprisoned, he refused to tell me.</p>

<p>This gentleman who sat in the buggy had been
to the cottage several times. High words had generally
attended his visits. I had once asked my
uncle who he was, and the fact that an answer was
refused, was enough to assure me that a better
knowledge of him would assist me in finding a clew
to my own history.</p>

<p>Mrs. Loraine appeared at the door, and "Tom"
nimbly leaped from his seat, and assisted her into
the buggy.</p>

<p>"Who was that young fellow that came out of
the house as I drove up?" asked he, as he took his
place at her side.</p>

<p>"Ernest Thornton," replied the lady.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed he, as he drove off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST RELEASES THE CAPTIVE MAIDEN
FROM HER PRISON.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WHAT the precise signification was of the
"whew!" which the gentlemanly Tom had
uttered, I did not know; but it seemed to indicate
that he was not particularly pleased to learn that I
had been a visitor at the house. I felt that there
was work for me to do, which I could commence
at once by following out the clew afforded me by
Mrs. Loraine's visitor. My first business was to ascertain
who this gentleman was. Doubtless any one
in the house could tell me. Probably Kate knew
all about him, and I was all the more eager to see
her.</div>

<p>I walked down to the pier in a brown study.
Mrs. Loraine had positively refused to let me see
Kate, at the present time or in the future. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
again confined to her room, not to leave it, I judged,
for weeks, unless I put my plan of intervention into
execution. Her oppressor was away, and the present
seemed to be the most favorable time for releasing
the captive.</p>

<p>"Come, Ernest, are you going home, or not?"
called Bob, who was getting impatient at my delay.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Bob; there is something for us to do
before we go."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to leave Miss Kate here."</p>

<p>"I don't see what we can do about it," said he.</p>

<p>"I haven't any idea of leaving her to the tender
mercies of that tigress. She shall be a passenger in
the Splash," I added, as I stepped into the boat, and
sat down in the standing-room. "I want to see her
for my own sake as well as hers. I've had an idea
since you left me."</p>

<p>"An idea?" queried he.</p>

<p>"Yes, a big idea. You know my story as well
as I know it myself, and I don't mean to keep anything
from you."</p>

<p>"What's up, Ernest?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to know who and what I am; and I'm
going to find out, if there is any such thing. I told
you about a well-dressed fellow who has been to the
cottage of my uncle several times."</p>

<p>"I remember all about him. He quarrelled with
your uncle, you said."</p>

<p>"That's the man. Well, Bob, the fellow that drove
up in that two-horse buggy, as we came out of the
house, was the very one who came to the cottage."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"Does he live in Cannondale?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he lives. I heard Mrs. Loraine
call him Tom, and that's all I know about him.
I'm going to find out who he is."</p>

<p>"If you can."</p>

<p>"Kate must know who he is, for he seems to be
a regular visitor at the house of Mrs. Loraine."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to get Kate out of the house."</p>

<p>"How, Ernest?"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know yet, but I shall find a way."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that would be rather high-handed?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't help it if it is. I would just as lief raise
a breeze over here as not."</p>

<p>"We shall get into a scrape, Ernest."</p>

<p>"I won't drag you into it, Bob. You may stay
on the boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I won't! I'm ready to take my share in
the enterprise."</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied this girl is abused, and it would
be mean in us to leave her to her fate. It's nearly
dark now, and there isn't any one in the garden.
I'm going up to take a look. Kate said her room
was in the attic."</p>

<p>"Yes; that's the one with the blinds closed."</p>

<p>I landed again, and Bob went with me up to the
house. There was no one in sight, and nothing to
prevent our doing the work we had undertaken immediately.
After examining the premises, I concluded
that we must release the captive maiden by means of
the window. It would not be prudent to enter by
the door, which was probably locked in the absence
of the lady.</p>

<p>I visited the stable on the grounds in search of
a rope; but I found there a ladder, which suited me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
better. With the assistance of Bob, I carried this
to the rear of the house, and raised it to the window.
I ascended to the window, and found that
the blinds were nailed on the outside, so that they
could not be opened. This was some confirmation
of the truth of Kate's story. I descended again,
and found a hammer in the stable, with which I
returned and removed the nails.</p>

<p>"Kate!" I called, as soon as I had opened the
blinds.</p>

<p>"O, Ernest Thornton!" exclaimed she, opening
the window. "I felt sure that you had deserted me.
I am so glad you have come!"</p>

<p>"We have no time to spare. Get your clothes as
quick as possible; tie them up in a bundle, and
throw them out the window."</p>

<p>She did not occupy many minutes in this preparation
for her departure. The bundle was made up
and thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>"How am I to get out?" asked she, glancing
blankly at the ladder.</p>

<p>"Can you go down stairs and go out by the
door?" I asked, willing to spare her the descent by
the ladder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="500" height="392" alt="THE RESCUE OF THE CAPTIVE MAIDEN.&mdash;Page 49." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE RESCUE OF THE CAPTIVE MAIDEN.&mdash;Page 49.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot; the door is locked," she replied, in
trembling tones, for she was violently agitated by
the situation.</p>

<p>"Then you must go down by the ladder," I added,
ascending a few rounds higher. "Now give me your
hands, and don't be afraid, for I can hold you so
that you cannot fall."</p>

<p>I braced myself upon the ladder, which I directed
Bob to hold firmly in its place, and took her by
both hands. It was a perilous feat to step from the
window to the ladder, and she was so terrified that
I held her whole weight; but the passage was safely
effected. I held her by the hands till she reached
the ground, for she was so timid I dared not trust
her to her own energies. I went up again, closed
the blinds, and restored the nails, hoping that the
escape of the prisoner would not be discovered before
the next day. The ladder was conveyed to the
stable, and placed where we had found it.</p>

<p>"Now run down to the pier and get into the boat
as fast as you can," said I to Kate. "Crawl into the
cuddy, and keep out of sight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think any one will catch me?" asked
she, quivering with terror.</p>

<p>"No; there is no person near to catch you," I
replied, as I picked up her bundle of clothes.</p>

<p>We reached the boat without meeting any person,
though Mrs. Loraine's man drove the cow into the
yard just as we were pushing off from the pier. I
had only lowered the jib of the Splash, so that she
was ready to start without any delay; and in a few
moments we were standing up the lake, the breeze
still fresh from the north-west.</p>

<p>"You may come out now, Kate," I called to
our passenger, when we were half a mile from the
pier.</p>

<p>"Am I perfectly safe?" she asked, timidly, as she
crawled out of the cuddy.</p>

<p>"Yes; no one can see you now. Sit down on this
seat, and don't be alarmed."</p>

<p>"What shall we do with Miss Loraine now we
have released her?" asked Bob, as she sat down by
his side in the standing-room.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied. "We will settle that
question before we go on shore. What did Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Loraine do to you when you went into the house,
Kate?"</p>

<p>"She spoke to me very severely, and sent me to
my room. She told me I should not come out again
for a month."</p>

<p>"She was mistaken this time, if she never was
before," said Bob, with a congratulatory smile.</p>

<p>"She was, indeed; and O, I'm so thankful to you!"</p>

<p>"Do you know where Mrs. Loraine has gone now?"
I asked, approaching the subject which was so near
my own heart.</p>

<p>"I don't; I heard a carriage drive up the yard. I
suppose she has gone out to ride," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"A gentleman drove up to the door in a two-horse
buggy. Do you know who the gentleman
was?" I asked, anxiously. "Mrs. Loraine called him
Tom."</p>

<p>"O, that was Mr. Thornton," she answered.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes; is he any relation to you!"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of," I replied, musing upon
the fact that he bore my name.</p>

<p>"He often comes to see Mrs. Loraine, and people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
say they are engaged to be married," continued
Kate.</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"I'm not very sure, but I think it is in Philadelphia.
He stays at the Cannondale Hotel about a week
at a time, and comes to Mrs. Loraine's every day."</p>

<p>"How often does he come to Cannondale?"</p>

<p>"Every two or three months, I should think. But
I don't see much of him. I have been kept in my
chamber most of the time," she added, sadly.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear him speak about Amos Thornton,
my uncle?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"You say he is going to be Mrs. Loraine's husband."</p>

<p>"That's what people say; I don't know anything
about it, only that he is very often at the house."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about Mr. Thornton?"
I continued. "Is he rich?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether he is or not. I think he
must be. He always takes her out to ride with a
span of fine horses."</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Loraine very rich herself?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is not very rich herself. She has what my
father left her by his will."</p>

<p>"Of course your father left something to you,"
added Bob Hale.</p>

<p>"Mr. Windleton called me a little heiress two years
ago, and said I should have forty thousand dollars
when I was old enough to receive it."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Windleton?"</p>

<p>"He was a great friend of my father. He keeps
the money that belongs to me. I forget what they
call him."</p>

<p>"A trustee," suggested Bob, who was somewhat
earned in the law.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's what he said he was. My father
gave his wife only half as much as he gave me;
but I wish he had given her all of his property,"
said Kate, looking over into the water.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think she would have been kinder to me. Mr.
Windleton's daughter Ellen told me, if I should die,
that my money would go to Mrs. Loraine. I don't
know whether it is true or not;" and without any
apparent reason, Kate burst into tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob and I comforted her as well as we could.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she continued, when she had wiped
away her tears, "she hopes I shall die."</p>

<p>"I guess not," I added. "That would be horrible."</p>

<p>"Why does she treat me so then&mdash;not even let
me look out the window?" sobbed she. "I think
she wants my money. I have tried to think it was
not so, but I can't, ever since Ellen Windleton told
me that."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell Mr. Windleton how your
step-mother treats you?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"He and his whole family are in Europe. They
have been there more than a year. I shall tell him
when he comes back; but Mrs. Loraine is my guardian."</p>

<p>"Ernest, we are almost over to Parkville, and it is
time to know what we are to do with Miss Loraine.
It won't do to take her to Parkville," said
Bob.</p>

<p>"I will stay in the boat all night. That's a nice
little place in there," interposed Kate, pointing to the
cuddy.</p>

<p>"You may go in there now, if you please," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
added. "I will land you, Bob, and take care of Kate
myself. It is quite dark now, and I can take her
up to the cottage. No one will find her there."</p>

<p>"What will your uncle say?"</p>

<p>"He will not see her; if he does, he won't say
anything; he never says anything."</p>

<p>My friend was entirely willing to take his share
of the responsibility, but I was satisfied that I could
dispose of my fair passenger without any assistance.
I landed him at the steamboat pier, and then stood
over towards the cottage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST IS AWAKENED BY A LOUD
KNOCKING.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Splash continued on her course up the lake,
after I had landed Bob Hale. It was quite
dark, and I told Kate she need not stay in the cuddy
any longer. She came out, and sat down near
me. I was still in doubt as to what I should do
with her; and now that Bob had left me, the problem
seemed more difficult than before. Mrs. Loraine
was not a woman to let the matter rest where it
was. She was full of spirit and vindictiveness, and
as she was the legal guardian of Kate, she would
not let her escape pass unnoticed.</div>

<p>In the morning, if not before, it would be discovered
that the bird had flown. After the interest Bob
and I had manifested in the welfare of the young
lady, her guardian would know where to apply for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
information, and I might expect to hear from her in
the course of twenty-four hours, and it was not improbable
that the search would be commenced that
very evening. I told Kate, as we sailed along, that
her absence would create a tempest in the household
of her step-mother, and that we must be prepared for
vigorous proceedings on her part.</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't got you into trouble, Ernest
Thornton," said she, her tones indicating much anxiety.</p>

<p>"Never mind me, Kate. I am used to trouble,
and I can stand anything. I only hope I shall be
able to keep you safe from your enemies."</p>

<p>"Can't I stay in this boat? That cabin is a nice
place; I am sure it seems like a fairy palace to me,
compared with my prison house in the attic chamber."</p>

<p>"You might stay in the cabin a day or two; but
of course you can't live there for any great length
of time. You say you have an uncle in New York
city."</p>

<p>"I have. If I could only find him I should be
safe. I never saw him, at least not since I can remember;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
but as he is my father's brother, he must
be something like my father, and he will take care
of me."</p>

<p>"How can we get you to New York? That's
the question."</p>

<p>"If I could only reach the railroad, I should not
be afraid to go alone," she added, earnestly. "I am
sure I could find my uncle, for his name is not a
very common one."</p>

<p>"But I don't think it would be safe for you to
go alone. We must manage that some way or other,
though I hardly know how. It will need some
money to pay your fare."</p>

<p>"Dear me! so it will!" exclaimed she, blankly.
"And I haven't a single cent!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Kate; we will manage that. I can
raise the money for you, and see that you get to
New York."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Ernest Thornton," replied
she, warmly. "I shall have plenty of money some
time, and will pay you back every cent."</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble about that," I added.
"I am only thinking how I shall get you safely to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
your destination; but I am going to do it somehow or
other. Are you not afraid to stay in the boat all
night?"</p>

<p>"O, no! I'm not afraid of anything but my attic
chamber."</p>

<p>"My cabin isn't a bad place to stay in. I have
slept there a great many nights, in all parts of the
lake, sometimes miles from any house."</p>

<p>"I'm not a bit afraid, Ernest Thornton. Why, the
cabin is a splendid place, and there are two nice beds
there. I'm sure I don't want any better room than
that. I could live there a whole year."</p>

<p>"You will not have to stay there long. Just as
soon as I can get the money, and find some one to
go with you to New York, I shall sail up the creek,
where there is a railroad station, and you shall start
for New York. Now we are almost to the cottage
of my uncle, and you had better keep out of sight,
for I don't want any one to see you."</p>

<p>She crawled into the cuddy, and sat down on one
of the berths. I always moored the Splash about ten
rods from the shore, so that she could lie in the
deep water. The row-boat in which I came off to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
her was fastened to the buoy, so that I easily found
the place in the darkness, and made fast to the
moorings. I lowered my sails, and put every thing
in order as usual.</p>

<p>"Now, Kate, I think you will be perfectly safe
here. I will bring you off some supper very soon."</p>

<p>"I don't need any supper. Mrs. Loraine sent me
some before she went out to ride; but I could not
eat a mouthful."</p>

<p>"No matter; I will bring off something, and see
you again to-night."</p>

<p>I went ashore in the row-boat. My supper was
waiting for me in the dining-room. After I had
finished the meal, I buttered several slices of bread,
and wrapped them in a napkin, with some cheese
and some cake. Probably old Betsey, the housekeeper,
thought I had a ravenous appetite that night;
but she never asked any questions, or expressed any
surprise at anything which occurred at the cottage.
I pulled off to the boat again, and gave the contents
of the napkin to Kate.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I can't light the lantern, Kate," I
added, as I handed her the provisions; "but I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
afraid it would betray you, if Mrs. Loraine should
happen to come here in search of you to-night."</p>

<p>"I don't care to have a light. I am so rejoiced
to get away from my prison that I don't care for
anything," said she, with enthusiasm. "You don't
know how much I have suffered over there, Ernest
Thornton."</p>

<p>"I hope you have seen the last of it; but we must
be very careful. In the morning you must stay in
your cabin, for my uncle gets up very early, and
walks all about the place. You must not let him
see you on any account."</p>

<p>"I will not. I will be as careful as you can desire."</p>

<p>"In the morning I hope I shall be able to do
something with you."</p>

<p>"I shall trust myself wholly to you, Ernest Thornton,
and one of these days I hope to be able to
repay you for your goodness to me."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Kate; I am going to do what
I think is right because it is right. I suppose you
thought it was rather hard in me to take you ashore
at the pier over there, this afternoon; but I'm sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I shouldn't have dared to do what I have done if I
hadn't seen Mrs. Loraine, and satisfied myself that
she ill-treated you."</p>

<p>"I think you did just right, Ernest Thornton; but
I was willing to suffer rather than get you into
trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't care for myself; it don't make much difference
what happens to me. If I can only enable
you to reach your uncle in New York city, that is
all I want. But it is getting late now, and I think
you had better go to sleep. You can do as I do,
Kate, when I sleep on board. I always lock myself in."</p>

<p>I explained to her how this was done. There
were two doors opening into the cuddy, one on each
side of the mainmast, with a slide over each. Outside
of these doors were two round holes, which I
had sawed in the bulkhead for ventilation. By
reaching the arm through one of these apertures the
slide could be locked. I fastened Kate into the
cuddy, and then gave her the key, with which she
opened the door without difficulty herself.</p>

<p>"I shall keep a good lookout for you," said I, as
I pulled my tender alongside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not a bit afraid, Ernest Thornton," replied
she. "I shall pray for you, and thank God for giving
me such a good friend."</p>

<p>"Good night," I added, speaking through the
round hole.</p>

<p>"Good night; and don't worry about me," replied
she.</p>

<p>So far as her comfort was concerned, there was
not the least need of worrying about her, for the
cabin of the Splash was a miniature parlor. There
were two good hair mattresses in the berths, with
plenty of bed-clothes. The floor was carpeted, and
there was every convenience which so small an apartment
could contain. I had slept there for a week
together; and when my uncle had banished me from
his house, I had intended to live on board of her all
the time, and earn my living by carrying out parties.
So long as no one disturbed her, I had no fears in
regard to my guest in the boat.</p>

<p>But I was very much troubled about the final disposal
of her. It would not be safe for her to go to
New York alone. It might be several days before
she found her uncle, and it was not proper to subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a young girl like her to the perils of the great city
without a protector. I had no objection to making
a trip to New York myself. The spring vacation
would commence on the following Monday, and I
could be absent from home a whole week without
being missed, if I kept the Splash out of sight, for
my uncle would suppose I was off on a cruise in
her.</p>

<p>This plan pleased me, and I determined to carry
it out. School kept but two days more before the
vacation, and if I could only keep Kate out of sight
till Monday, everything would work well. The financial
question was not a difficult one to manage. I
calculated that about thirty dollars would pay the
expenses of the trip to the metropolis; and uncle
Amos would give me this sum or more, without asking
a single question. I had about ten dollars on
hand, which would be a sufficient margin for contingencies.</p>

<p>The whole matter was as luminous now as youth
and enthusiasm could wish; and I went to my chamber
satisfied that I had solved the problem. It
seemed to me that the only possible obstacle to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
complete success of my scheme would be the interference
of Mrs. Loraine and her friends. In the
morning, at farthest, the search for the escaped prisoner
would be commenced. But I could do nothing
to provide against emergencies in this direction. I
could only wait till I saw how "the land lay" in
the morning, and then trust to my own skill and
dash to overcome the difficulties as they presented
themselves. In my prayers I remembered poor Kate,
and asked the blessing of Heaven upon her. I felt
sure that the Good Father would help me to save
her from the cruel persecution to which she was subjected.
Having thus commended myself and Kate to
the care of Him who watches over the innocent, I
turned over and went to sleep.</p>

<p>My slumber was soon disturbed by a violent
pounding at the front door of the cottage, which
was just beneath my window. I leaped up in the
bed and listened. They were not doubtful sounds
that I heard, and they appeared to be made by the
heel of a heavy boot. The person who demanded
admission to the cottage at that unseemly hour was
evidently in earnest, and the door groaned under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
vigorous assaults he made upon it. Of course I could
not be uncertain in regard to the errand of the midnight
visitor&mdash;for such the striking of the clock in
the hall below now assured me he was. "The tug
of war" was at hand, and I was to be called upon
at once to "face the music."</p>

<p>I decided not to be forward in meeting the messenger
from Mrs. Loraine, whoever he was. It was
possible, if not probable, that she had sent the deputy
sheriff after me; and this terrible official might
hurry me off from my bed to a cell in the Cannondale
lockup, heedless of the fact that I was found
in another county. If I was arrested, what would
become of poor Kate? The cold sweat stood on my
brow as I thought of her. But I came to the conclusion
that I would not be arrested by any deputy
sheriff, or any one else, if I could possibly avoid it;
and it was a satisfaction for me to hear the wind
piping merrily at my window, for that would give
heels to the Splash, if a hurried departure became
necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST GETS AN IDEA.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE knocking at the door of the cottage was
continued almost without intermission. The visitor
was evidently endowed with only a small portion
of the necessary virtue of patience, for when he
ceased pounding for an instant, it was only to curse
and swear at the heaviness of the sleepers within. I
was sure that old Jerry and Betsey, who slept in
the rear of the house, would not hear the summons,
even if the imperative messenger broke the door
down; but I was rather surprised that my uncle,
who, I always supposed, slept with one eye open, if
he ever slept at all, did not answer the call more
promptly.</div>

<p>I got out of bed, and looked out at the window,
hoping to obtain a sight of the visitor; but the night
was too dark for me to distinguish his form or features.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Again he swore, and again he hammered
away at the door. What they do in New Jersey
when it rains is to <i>let</i> it rain; and what I did when
he pounded was to <i>let</i> him pound. I was perfectly
willing he should pound; I even hoped that he enjoyed
it. In spite of the anxiety I felt for poor
Kate, I could not help laughing at the ludicrous
earnestness with which he swore and pounded. Like
most men, my uncle was cool when he was not excited;
and as there had been nothing on the present
occasion to excite him, I suppose he was cool. Doubtless
he stopped to dress himself before he answered
the summons. Very likely the dread necessity of
speaking to the visitor appalled him, and he desired
to postpone the trying ordeal as long as possible.</p>

<p>I am obliged to acknowledge my belief that Mrs.
Loraine's messenger was exceedingly unreasonable, for
he did not intermit his hammering long enough to
ascertain whether any one was coming to the door
or not. What was not more than five minutes in
fact, might have seemed to be half an hour to him.
Within as short a time as could have been properly
expected, I heard the door of my uncle's library<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
open, and uneasily I listened for the result. The
bolt on the front door creaked and grated. The
door opened with difficulty, and while my uncle was
tugging at it, I lifted the sash of my window a
couple of inches, that I might hear what passed.</p>

<p>The door swung back, and I put my head to the
window to catch the first words that were spoken.
Of course my uncle was not the first to utter them;
he seldom spoke, and never was surprised into speaking,
even on an emergency.</p>

<p>"Well, governor," said the messenger, crustily,
"you sleep like a rock. Where is that confounded
boy of yours?"</p>

<p>"In bed," replied my uncle.</p>

<p>"Rout him out; I want him," continued the visitor,
pushing his way into the house.</p>

<p>This movement prevented me from hearing what
followed immediately; but I hastened to my door,
hoping to catch a word which would enable me to
determine who the person was.</p>

<p>"The young villain has run away with Mrs. Loraine's
step-daughter," I heard him say, as I opened
the door wide enough to permit me to catch the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sound. "I tell you, governor, you must get rid of
the young vagabond, or he will swamp the whole
of us."</p>

<p>"Hush! he will hear you," said uncle Amos.</p>

<p>"No matter. I have pounded away hard enough
to wake the dead. If that didn't rouse him, nothing
will," added the messenger, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Silence!"</p>

<p>"I have had about enough of this thing," continued
the rough visitor. "You insist on keeping the
whelp here, when you know he is a bombshell in
your path and mine. Why don't you send him to
sea, and let him get drowned?"</p>

<p>"Be still, Thomas," replied my uncle, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I won't be still, governor. The vagabond has
run away with that girl, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>They passed into the dining-room, and I could not
hear the rest of the sentence. The visitor was Tom
Thornton, for my uncle called him Thomas. I was
a vagabond, and a bombshell in the path of both of
them. Tom called my uncle "governor," and this
indicated that he was his son. I half suspected this
before, but it was news to me to learn that I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
regarded as a dangerous young man. Why was I
dangerous? I had not done anything to imperil the
life or the fortunes of either of them.</p>

<p>My uncle would not tell me anything about my
father, or my mother, save that the latter was insane
and the inmate of an asylum. Now, Tom objected
because I had not been sent to sea to be drowned!
They were talking about me down stairs, and I
slipped on my pants, and crept down the stairs. I
found that they had entered my uncle's library, and
the spring lock on the door had fastened it. I listened,
but I could not distinguish what was said.</p>

<p>I was determined not to be balked in my purpose,
for this was an opportunity which might not occur
again for years to obtain some clew to my own
affairs. In fact, I had resolutely resolved to SEEK
AND FIND my mother, who was still living; and I
wanted information.</p>

<p>The library of my uncle was contained in an addition
to the house which had been erected after the
completion of the original structure. It was on the
end of the house, and could be reached only through
his chamber. The roof was flat, and covered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
tin plates. On the side fronting the lake there was
a bay window. The middle sash was generally open
at the top in warm weather, as I had no doubt it
was at the present time.</p>

<p>I stole softly up stairs to my chamber, from which
one of the windows opened upon the flat roof over
the library. I raised this window, and crawled like
a cat over to the bay window, the top of which was
considerably lower than the roof. Lying down on
the projection, I placed my head near the top of
the window. I was rejoiced to find that I could
hear the voices of the occupants of the room below
me. More than this, a lucky thought, as I regarded
it, occurred to me as I lay there. The window
was pulled down at the top, and I found that I
could get into the room almost as easily as I could
stay out. I deemed this an important discovery,
for I fully intended, at the first convenient opportunity,
to explore the library. Though the thought
came to me, I did not follow out its leading at this
time.</p>

<p>"How can I get rid of him?" demanded uncle
Amos, as I placed my head near the open sash; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it was evident that the parties had made some progress
in the discussion while I was securing my position.</p>

<p>"Send him off. I can find a place for him in a
store in New Orleans, where the yellow fever will
make an end of him," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Thomas, I will not harm him. I don't want to
kill him," added uncle Amos.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't want to kill him&mdash;let the
fever do that. Let him go away, and lose the run
of you. Something must be done at once. He is a
smart boy, they say, and if he should happen to get
an idea, he would blow you and me so high that
we never should come down."</p>

<p>That was an idea, and I happened to get it.</p>

<p>"My son, I have stained my soul with crime for
your sake," added my uncle, bitterly. "We have
wronged this boy enough. I will not have him injured."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to injure him, only to get him out
of the way, so that he will lose the run of you,"
replied Tom, petulantly. "He don't know anything
about me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't flatter yourself, Tom Thornton," I thought,
but did not say.</p>

<p>"I am willing to do anything proper to be done
with him. He will graduate soon at the Institute,
and we must find a place for him in some business,"
said uncle Amos.</p>

<p>"I will find a situation for him in New Orleans."</p>

<p>"Not to take his life."</p>

<p>"No, no; certainly not. I know of a firm there
that wants a young man from the north, and you
must send him off in the course of a week. Now,
what has the villain done with that girl?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; he has not brought her here," answered
my uncle.</p>

<p>"What has he done with her? There was a
young fellow with him; do you know who he was?"</p>

<p>"Probably the Hale boy. They run together."</p>

<p>"What could they have done with the girl?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What motive had they for carrying
her off?"</p>

<p>"Out of pity I suppose. Kate is a careless girl,
wilful, and disobedient. She objects to being shut
up in her chamber for her misdemeanors."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Thornton related the incident in which Bob
and I had been concerned on the pier.</p>

<p>"The child must have been badly abused, or she
would not have jumped into the lake," said uncle
Amos, when he had heard the story.</p>

<p>"It does not concern you or me whether she has
been or not. I fancy the girl is not of much use
to any one."</p>

<p>"Why do you run after her, then?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of arguing the question. Mrs.
Loraine wishes me to find the girl, and return her;
and I'm going to do it, if I have to choke your
smart boy to get at it. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In his chamber; but you must not harm him,"
replied uncle Amos, nervously. "He is as high-spirited
as his father was."</p>

<p>"What do I care for that? He must tell me
where the girl is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will not be willing to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I shall make him do so," added Tom, savagely;
and it seemed to me he was getting up a
very pleasant prospect for me.</p>

<p>"You must handle him very carefully," said my
uncle, nervously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he tells me where the girl is, that's all I want
of him. If he don't, I shall&mdash;I shall crush it out of
him. He will find I am not made of milk and
water."</p>

<p>"You will find I am not, either," I said to myself,
as, when Tom moved towards the door, I rose from
my recumbent posture, and hastened back to my
chamber.</p>

<p>I slipped off my pants, and got into bed again,
that I might not be suspected of having left it. I
had scarcely done so before Tom entered my room
with a lamp in his hand. I opened my eyes, rubbed
them, and stared at him.</p>

<p>"I want to see you, youngster," he began. "I suppose
you don't know me. My name is Jones."</p>

<p>"If your name is Jones, my name is Smith," I replied,
with gross imprudence.</p>

<p>He looked at me, and appeared to be startled by
my sharp and reckless reply. Very likely he thought
me as smart as my reputation.</p>

<p>"Your name is Thornton," said he.</p>

<p>"So is yours," I answered; and I couldn't help it.</p>

<p>He stared at me again. Perhaps he concluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that I had obtained my information of Kate Loraine,
and he knew that I had seen him at her step-mother's
house.</p>

<p>"What have you done with that girl?" demanded
he.</p>

<p>"Hold on a moment till I dress myself," I replied,
as I jumped out of bed, and began to put on my
clothes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH MR.
TOM THORNTON.</h3>


<div class='cap'>FROM my perch over the bay window of the
library, I had heard Tom Thornton express
his savage determination to crush out of me the
information he wanted. Being forewarned, I was
in a measure forearmed, and I did not intend to be
caught in a vulnerable position. I decided to do a
little light skirmishing before the battle opened.
What I had seen and heard of my assailant gave
me a wonderful self-possession, for which I could not
account to myself.</div>

<p>I hurried on my clothing, though I dressed myself
with the expectation of taking a cruise on the
lake before my head rested on the pillow again.
Though I felt that it was my first duty to protect
Kate Loraine, and send her to a place of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
safety, I fully realized that I had a battle of my
own to fight. By their own confession, Tom and his
father had wronged me deeply. If my mother was
still living, as I believed she was, they had probably
wronged her a hundred fold more than me. With
these thoughts and feelings, an impulse of desperation
seemed to inspire me. I was ready for anything,
but I was astonished and amazed at my own calmness.</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm going to wait all night for an
answer?" demanded Tom, gruffly, before I had half
finished dressing myself.</p>

<p>"If I am to give the answer, I expect you will
wait till I get ready," I replied.</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed?" stormed he.</p>

<p>"I do, indeed."</p>

<p>He moved towards me, and I retreated to a corner
of the room, where stood a heavy base-ball bat, which
had been presented to me for skilful playing. That
corner was my base of supplies.</p>

<p>"Do you know where that girl is?" said he, pausing
and glancing at my muscular artillery in the
corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, till I am dressed, and I will
answer the question."</p>

<p>"Answer it now&mdash;this instant."</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you young villain? Do you
intend to insult me?"</p>

<p>"That question is rather refreshing, Mr. Tom Thornton,
after coming to my room in the middle of the
night as you did. Do you mean to insult me?"</p>

<p>"Insult you, you young villain!" sneered he.</p>

<p>"Insult me, you old villain! for I'm sure you have
had a deal of experience in the villain line."</p>

<p>"Will you answer my question, or not? Do you
know where that girl is?" he continued, when he
saw it was as easy for me to use harsh epithets as
for him.</p>

<p>"When I have dressed myself I will answer, but
not till then," I replied, adjusting my collar with more
than usual care. "Mr. Tom Thornton, I don't wish
to quarrel with you on our first acquaintance. Besides
it don't look well for near relations to quarrel."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by near relations?" he asked,
evincing some alarm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your name is Thornton, and so is mine. As you
come to the house of my uncle, I suppose we must
be relations. But I assure you I have no particular
desire to claim kindred with you."</p>

<p>"You are an impudent young cub; and if you are
any relation to me, you shall have some of the starch
taken out of you before you grow half an inch taller,"
replied Tom; and in the war of words I felt that
I had the weather-gage of him, for I knew things
of which he supposed I was entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>"I don't think my impudence exceeds yours, Mr.
Tom Thornton. You didn't come into my room behaving
like a gentleman," I answered, as I put on
my sack coat.</p>

<p>"I am not in the habit of having a boy speak to
me as you do."</p>

<p>"I am not in the habit of having any one speak
to me as you do," I retorted. "But I don't want to
quarrel with you, as I said before."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Ernest Thornton, if your high mightiness
is ready to condescend to answer my question,
I must beg the favor of a reply," sneered he, putting
the lamp down upon the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take a seat, Mr. Thornton. Your speech is improving,"
I added, throwing myself into a chair near
my base of supplies.</p>

<p>I think my visitor was entirely satisfied by this
time that he could make nothing by bullying me;
and it seemed to me that in reaching this point I had
accomplished a great deal. Tom Thornton sat down
in a chair, near the table where he had deposited the
lamp.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Ernest Thornton. I am seated,
and await your further pleasure," he continued, with
a curling lip.</p>

<p>"You intimated that you came on business."</p>

<p>"I certainly hinted as much as that."</p>

<p>"And your business relates to Miss Kate Loraine?"</p>

<p>"It does. I took the liberty to inquire if you knew
where she was at the present time. A direct and
unequivocal answer to this question would oblige
your humble servant very much," said Tom, nervously;
and I saw that it was with the greatest difficulty
he could confine himself to this satirical style
of speech&mdash;for he wanted to break out in menace
and violence, to crush me with hard words and savage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
demonstrations, which prudent cunning restrained
him from using. "Do you know where the girl is?"</p>

<p>"I do," I replied, promptly. "I trust my reply is
sufficiently direct and unequivocal."</p>

<p>"It is; and you will oblige me by informing me,
as directly and unequivocally, <i>where</i> she is," said he,
rising from his chair.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disoblige you, Mr. Tom Thornton;
but I must respectfully decline to give you any information
on that point," I answered, firmly.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you refuse to tell me
where she is?" demanded he, turning up the cuff of
one of his coat-sleeves.</p>

<p>"That was the idea I intended to convey," I replied,
imitating his example by rolling up one of my
coat-sleeves.</p>

<p>"You won't tell me."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You know where she is?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And won't tell?"</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>He turned up the other coat-sleeve, and I did the
same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, youngster, we have played
this farce long enough," Tom proceeded, in a rage.
"I want you to understand that I am not to be
trifled with. You may make a fool of the old man,
but you can't make a fool of me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps nature has already done that kindly act
for you," I put in, as he paused to take a long breath
with which to whet his wrath.</p>

<p>I know, now, that it was wrong for me to make
these saucy and irritating replies; but I could not
well help it then. Tom Thornton was a villain, by
his own confession. My uncle had declared that he
had stained his soul with crime for his son's sake.
Whichever was the greater villain, it was clear that
the son was the more obdurate, graceless, and unrepentant
of the two. I had no patience with him. I
had no respect for him, and I certainly had no fear
of him. Even policy would not permit me to treat
him with a consideration I did not feel.</p>

<p>"For your insults we will settle by and by; at
present my business relates to this girl," said he,
smarting under my charge.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Tom Thornton, so far as Miss Loraine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is concerned, your business with me is finished," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Not yet; before I have done you will be glad to
tell me where the girl is."</p>

<p>"I will tell you nothing in regard to her."</p>

<p>"I command you to tell me where she is."</p>

<p>"You may command, if you choose."</p>

<p>"And I will be obeyed," said he, furiously.</p>

<p>"You will see whether you are or not."</p>

<p>"Who are you, young man, that have the impudence
to enter the house of a lady, and entice away
her daughter?" foamed he.</p>

<p>"I am Ernest Thornton. I did not enter the house
after you rode off with the lady; I did not entice
the girl away, and she is not the lady's daughter."</p>

<p>"Silence! Don't you contradict me. You ran away
with the girl!"</p>

<p>I whistled a popular air, simply to prove that I
was not intimidated, and that Tom was not getting
along very rapidly.</p>

<p>"Once more, and for the last time," roared Tom,
foaming with passion, "will you tell me where the
girl is, or will you take the consequences?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it's all the same to you, I'll take the consequences,"
I answered.</p>

<p>"Very well; you will take them, or you will tell
me the whole truth," said he, savagely, as he rushed
to the door.</p>

<p>There was a key in the lock, which I seldom or
never used. He took it out, left the room, and
locked the door behind him. He was evidently so
much in earnest that he did not intend I should
escape the fiery furnace he was preparing for me.
I could not but laugh at his folly in thinking to confine
a live boy of sixteen in the chamber of a cottage.
I concluded that he had gone for a stick, a
club, or some other weapon, with which to reduce me
to subjection.</p>

<p>Though I felt able with the base-ball bat to defend
myself from the assaults of Tom, I did not court
the conflict. There was room for an accident which
might deprive me of the power to serve Kate in the
hour of her extremity; and I was disposed to keep
her on the safe side, if I did not keep there myself.
I heard the heavy footsteps of Tom Thornton, as he
descended the stairs, and walked through the hall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I concluded that he would see my uncle before he
returned. I slipped off my shoes, and put one in
each side pocket of my sack. Fearing that my bat
might be removed during my absence, I thrust it
up the chimney, at the fireplace, resting one end
on a jamb, where I could easily reach it.</p>

<p>Carefully opening the window, I stepped down upon
the roof of the library, and thence to the top of the
bay window, to the position I had before occupied.
My uncle was in the library, but Tom was not with
him, and I concluded that he had gone out of the
cottage for the weapon he wanted. I felt safe
enough, however; for, by lying down on the top
of the bay window, close to the wall of the building,
I could not be seen by any one who did not
come close to the place where I was concealed.</p>

<p>I bent over and looked into the library window a
second time. By the side of the grate, at the end
of the room, a small iron safe had been built into
the brick-work of the chimney, in which my uncle
kept his papers and other valuables. In the occasional
visits I had made to the library, after I was
conscious of the mystery which shrouded my affairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I had gazed wistfully at the iron door of this safe,
and longed to possess the secrets which it contained.
I believed that there were papers in that strong box
which could tell me where my mother was, or give
me some clew to her place of imprisonment. Perhaps
the whole history of my father's family was contained
within its iron sides. Perhaps the story of my
wrongs could be traced from the documents there.
If not, why was I so carefully excluded from the
library?</p>

<p>I felt a deep and thrilling interest when I glanced
into the room, and saw uncle Amos seated before the
open door of this safe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST VISITS HIS UNCLE'S LIBRARY.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WHILE Tom Thornton was looking for a battery
with which to reduce my fortress, my
uncle appeared to be searching for some paper in
his safe. I concluded that Tom's unexpected arrival
had suggested some business to be done with him.
I was in a fever of anxiety to hear what passed
between them.</div>

<p>Uncle Amos handled the papers, folding and unfolding
them, giving each a hasty glance, and then
restoring it to the safe. One document in particular
attracted my attention, on which my uncle gazed
much longer than on any other, and then laid it
down, apart from the others, on the bottom of the
safe. While I was watching his motions with breathless
interest, I heard the front door slammed violently.
My uncle was startled. He hastily closed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the door of the safe, locked it, and put the key under
the cushion of his arm-chair. Taking the lamp in his
hand, he hastened out of the room.</p>

<p>"Thomas!" I heard him call, after he had passed
into his chamber.</p>

<p>In a moment he returned to the library, followed
by Tom, who had in his hand a heavy stick taken
from the wood-pile.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" demanded my
uncle, as he glanced at the club in Tom's hand.</p>

<p>"I am going to make that boy tell me where the
girl is," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"With that stick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with this stick."</p>

<p>"You will never find the girl in that way," said
my uncle, shaking his head. "Throw your stick
away."</p>

<p>"But the rascal insulted me with almost every
word he spoke," growled Tom.</p>

<p>"I told you to handle him gently. You can't
drive him."</p>

<p>"But he must tell me where the girl is."</p>

<p>"He will not, of course. If he thinks the girl has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
been abused, he is just foolish enough to take her
part, and would be pounded to a jelly before he
would tell you a word about her. If you are careful
you can find out where the girl is. Probably he
carried her off in the boat. You say it must have
been nearly dark when he left Cannondale. He could
not have gone far with her. Either she is at Mr.
Hale's in Parkville, or she is concealed somewhere
in this vicinity."</p>

<p>Uncle Amos appeared to gasp with the mighty
effort this long speech had cost him.</p>

<p>"The young rascal shall tell me where she is, or
I will break his head. I will teach him that he can't
trifle with me, if he can with you," replied Tom,
in snappish tones.</p>

<p>"You will defeat your own purposes. Where is
Ernest now?"</p>

<p>"In his room; and I locked him in," answered
Tom, with a kind of chuckle, indicating that he
thought he had done a big thing.</p>

<p>"Locked him in!" exclaimed my uncle. "How
long do you suppose he will stay there?"</p>

<p>"Till I choose to let him out," said Tom, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
still appeared to be very well satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>"I think not. There are two windows in the
room, and when he gets ready to leave he will do
so. You seem to think the boy is a fool. Very
likely he has taken the alarm by this time, and has
gone off to look out for the girl, if he has hidden
her in this vicinity."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he has gone?" asked Tom; and
his tones indicated his perplexity.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but you can't do anything till
daylight, and I want to talk with you about our
affairs."</p>

<p>"Confound your affairs!" ejaculated Tom, petulantly.
"I can't stop to-night to talk about them. I
came after the girl, and I must have her too."</p>

<p>"Thomas, I can no longer endure this wasting
anxiety," continued my uncle, solemnly. "This boy
haunts me by day and by night. I seldom sleep an
hour at a time. For your sake I am suffering all
this; but you are cold, distant, and harsh to me."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do, governor?" demanded
the reckless son. "I send you all the
money you want."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not money, but a clear conscience, that I
need," groaned the wretched old man. "I would
rather live in abject poverty than purchase plenty
at such a fearful price."</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, governor."</p>

<p>"I live in constant fear of the boy, especially since
he questioned me, months ago, about his parents and
his property."</p>

<p>"Of course you told him he had no property."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right. In the course of a week we
will send him to New Orleans. When he has gone
you can change your residence, and he will lose the
track of you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will not be willing to go to New
Orleans; he certainly will not under such treatment
as you bestow upon him. Thomas, my brother's
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>My uncle paused and looked at his son, as though
in doubt whether to finish the sentence he had
begun.</p>

<p>"Well, what of the will?" demanded Tom, evincing
more interest than he had before exhibited.
"Of course you destroyed that years ago?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Thomas, I dared not do such a thing," replied
my uncle, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"You did not!" exclaimed Tom. "Where is it?
Let me have it!"</p>

<p>"No, Thomas, I dare not even yet destroy it,"
groaned the old man.</p>

<p>"This is madness!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. I wished to talk with you about
it. It is no longer safe for me to keep it in the
house."</p>

<p>"Why don't you burn it, then?"</p>

<p>"I dare not."</p>

<p>By this time I was so dizzy holding my head
down, that I was obliged to raise it. I was so
giddy and confused that I came very near rolling
off the top of the bay window; and in my efforts to
save myself, I made a noise, which disturbed the
conference. Tom and my uncle were alarmed. I
heard them rush out of the room. Without waiting
to ascertain their intentions, I put on my shoes, and
climbed down from the bay window to the ground.</p>

<p>I had hardly accomplished my descent before Tom
and my uncle appeared at the window of my chamber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
They had rightly attributed the noise to me,
and hastened to my room to learn what had happened.</p>

<p>"He has escaped," said Tom, as he drew in his
head, after satisfying himself that I was not on the
roof.</p>

<p>I went round to the front of the house to ascertain
what they would do next. There was a horse
and chaise in the road, with which Tom had come,
the animal fastened to a post. He neighed as I
approached him. I found that he was shivering in
the cool night air, after the severe sweat he had had
in coming. I took a robe from the chaise and covered
him, for I liked a horse almost as well as a
boat. When I had finished this kindly act, Tom
came out of the house with a lantern in his hand.
He was followed by my uncle, and they went down
to the landing, where my skiff lay.</p>

<p>"He hasn't gone off in the boat," said my uncle.</p>

<p>"And he shall not," added Tom, as he walked off
and disappeared behind the house.</p>

<p>I was alarmed lest he should go off to the Splash
and find Kate there; but presently he returned with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
an axe in his hand. Giving the lantern to his father,
he proceeded to smash the skiff with the axe, his
object being to prevent my going on board the
Splash. I regarded it as a puny effort on his part,
and was relieved to find they did not intend to visit
her themselves. As soon as I was satisfied in regard
to his purpose, I crept carefully up to the horse, unfastened
him, and jumped into the chaise. The animal
was full of spirit, and anxious to go.</p>

<p>"Have you found the girl?" I shouted to Tom,
as I drove within a few feet of where he stood.</p>

<p>He sprang for the horse's head as soon as he discovered
my intention; but I gave him the rein, and
he went off like a rocket. I turned towards Parkville,
and after going half a mile, I reined up to ascertain
whether I was pursued or not. I could hear
nothing; so I turned into a by-road, leading to a
grove. I had taken this step only to procure a diversion
of Tom's plans, if he had any, and I fastened
the horse to a tree. Covering him up with the robe
again, I walked back to the highway. In less than
ten minutes, I heard the well-known rattle of my
uncle's buggy. I stepped behind a bush till it should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pass. As it went by, I heard my uncle's voice, as
well as Tom's. My diversion had worked well, for
both had gone in pursuit of me, and I was delighted
with the result.</p>

<p>As fast as my legs would carry me, I hastened
back to the cottage. A light was burning in the
library. I was almost choking with anxiety, for I
had a purpose to accomplish. I climbed up to the
bay window, pulled the sash down, and leaped into
my uncle's "<i>sanctum sanctorum</i>." With trembling
hand I raised the cushion of the arm-chair. I could
hardly repress a shout of joy, as I saw the key, just
where my uncle had put it. Eagerly I seized it and
opened the safe door. I grasped the huge document
that lay on the bottom of the safe, and opened it.
I read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'In the name of God, amen! I, Ezra Thornton,
being feeble in body, but of sound and disposing
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is my father's will!" I exclaimed, without
pausing to read any more.</p>

<p>My heart was in my mouth. I glanced at other
papers; but I did not understand them, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
seemed to me then that the will was all I wanted.
I thrust that into my pocket, and was about to close
the safe door when my eye rested upon a thick pile
of bank bills. I wanted money. Would it be stealing
to take some of these bills? No! All that my
uncle had was mine, according to his own statement.
There were thousands of dollars in the pile.
I could not think or reason in the excitement of
the moment. I took about one fourth of the bills,
thrust them into my pocket, closed the door of the
safe, locked it, and put the key under the cushion
in the chair.</p>

<p>I got out of the window, and placed the sash as
I had found it. When I reached the ground, the
cold sweat stood on my brow, so violent were my
emotions. I entered the front door of the cottage,
passing old Jerry on the way, and went to my
chamber, the key being on the outside, where Tom
had left it. I prayed that God would forgive me
if I had done wrong, for I could not determine
whether I had or not.</p>

<span class="caption">ERNEST DEFENDS HIMSELF.&mdash;Page 99.</span>
</div>

<p>As the will and the money would not be safe in
my pocket, I wrapped them up in a piece of newspaper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and concealed them in the closet. By this
time it was daylight. I sat for half an hour in a
chair, thinking what I should do. At sunrise Tom
and his father returned. I suppose old Jerry told
them he had seen me, for both came up stairs immediately.</p>

<p>"Now, you young villain!" yelled Tom, as he
rushed towards me, beside himself with passion.</p>

<p>I retreated towards the chimney, and pulled out
my bat.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with that?" demanded
he.</p>

<p>"I am going to defend myself," I replied, as firmly
as I could; but I was terribly agitated.</p>

<p>"We'll see if you are;" and he sprang towards
me.</p>

<p>"Gently, Thomas; don't be rash," interposed my
uncle.</p>

<p>"Keep your distance, or I'll smash your head!" I
added, making a few vigorous passes with the bat.</p>

<p>He was prudent enough to heed this warning, and
left the room, but only to return with the club he
had selected before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST, AFTER A SUCCESSFUL RETREAT,
FALLS INTO A TRAP.</h3>


<div class='cap'>TOM THORNTON was the maddest man I ever
saw when he returned to my chamber armed
with the club. His father had followed him down
stairs, evidently for the purpose of pacifying him; and
when they returned he was still trying to dissuade
him from any act of violence.</div>

<p>"Don't be rash, Thomas," pleaded my uncle, as
they were coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me, governor. I will bring the
young cub to his senses!" roared Tom, violently.</p>

<p>"Control your temper, and listen to reason. You
will ruin yourself and me by your rashness."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that," replied Tom, as he rushed
into the room.</p>

<p>Uncle Amos caught him by the shoulder when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
reached the door and attempted to detain him; but
Tom was in such a fury that nothing could check
him. He shook off his father, and advanced towards
me, apparently with the intention of making an end
of me. I raised the heavy bat, and looked him steadfastly
in the eye. I was the cooler of the two, and
the experience I had had in a hand-to-hand fight
with Mr. Parasyte gave me both courage and skill
for such a conflict.</p>

<p>He came upon me with reckless vehemence, aiming
a blow at my head; but I struck at and hit his
club with such force that it was knocked out of his
hands, and flew over into one corner of the room.
Quick to take advantage of this favorable circumstance,
I ran to the spot, and put my foot on the stick, in
order to hold the weapon I had captured.</p>

<p>Tom rushed forward to recover his club at any
hazard, but I laid about me, right and left, with all
my might, so that the bat whizzed through the air.
To have come within the circle of the flying bat
would have insured him a broken head, and he
paused a moment. My uncle stepped forward, and
taking him by the shoulder, drew him back from
such dangerous proximity to my weapon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"One of you will certainly be killed!" gasped my
uncle. "Stop, Ernest!"</p>

<p>"I am ready to stop when he is," I replied, panting
with my exertions.</p>

<p>"What have you done with my horse, you villain?"
roared Tom.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when you have cooled off," I answered.
"I want you to understand now that I am
not to be trifled with."</p>

<p>"I'll bring you to your senses, yet," said Tom, with
an awful scowl, as he turned and rushed out of the
room again, followed by my uncle.</p>

<p>It was plain that he had gone after another
weapon, and perhaps this time he would bring
something more dangerous than a stick from the
wood-pile. Fighting was not at all to my taste,
and I was not quite willing to risk my prowess
against such an insane assailant. I realized that he
would just as lief kill me as not, and I might not
again be as fortunate as I had been during the first
onslaught. Discretion was certainly the better part
of valor in such an encounter, for there were no
laurels to be won in the battle; and I determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to make my escape before the return of my savage
foe. I did not mean to come back, for my mission
was in the great world until I had developed the
mystery of my own wrongs.</p>

<p>I approached the closet, after I had opened the
window, for the purpose of obtaining the will and
the money I had concealed there. I was on the
point of opening the closet, when I heard a step on
the stairs, and then my uncle appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Ernest, if you have any regard for me, or any
gratitude for what I have done for you, don't incense
him any more," said he, in pleading tones.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?&mdash;let him kill me?" I replied.</p>

<p>"What have you done with the horse and
chaise?"</p>

<p>"They are in Welch's Lane."</p>

<p>"Don't resist Thomas any more."</p>

<p>"I shall resist him to the death, if he don't let me
alone," I answered, firmly. "I didn't begin it."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, Ernest. You carried the girl off,
and he is acting for her mother."</p>

<p>"The girl has been abused. If she hadn't been,
she wouldn't have jumped overboard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"There! Thomas is coming!" exclaimed he, greatly
alarmed at the prospect of a renewal of hostilities.
"Tell him where the girl is, for my sake, if not for
your own."</p>

<p>"I will not," I replied, as I heard Tom's step on
the stairs.</p>

<p>The window was open, and while there was yet
time, I leaped out upon the roof of the library, with
the bat still in my hand. Throwing the weapon
down, I stepped on the bay window, and from that
dropped to the ground. Picking up the bat, I retreated
to the grove which bordered the lake beyond
the house. I had left the valuables in the closet, and
was therefore not prepared to take my final departure.</p>

<p>I had advanced but a few steps before Tom and
his father appeared at the window. My furious foe
staid there only long enough to obtain a sight of
me. A moment afterwards he rushed out at the front
door, and started in pursuit of me. I doubted just
then whether I had gained any advantage by transferring
the battle-ground to the open air, for Tom's
legs were longer than mine, though probably he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not practised running so much as I had. Taking
the path near the bank of the lake, I ran with all
my speed, till I came to the brook which flowed
round the hill in the rear of the cottage and discharged
itself into the lake. For some distance above
the outlet the stream was from ten to fifteen feet
wide. There was a rude foot-bridge, consisting of a
single wide plank, across it, for my uncle's domain
extended a short distance beyond it.</p>

<p>I crossed this bridge. Tom was only a few rods
behind me, and a brilliant strategic idea flashed into
my mind as I stepped upon the plank. As it is
considered good policy for a retreating army to destroy
the bridges behind it, I adopted the suggestion,
and as soon as I had reached the other side of
the brook, I lifted the end of the plank, and pulled
it over after me. Tom rushed up to the other side
just as I had completed the job. The stream was a
good ten feet wide, and its banks were rather soft
and slippery.</p>

<p>From the movements he made, I thought, at first,
that he intended to leap over the brook; and I
placed myself in such a position as to insure his falling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
into the water, if he attempted such a piece of
gymnastics. Tom wore nice clothes, and he did not
run the risk of soiling them by a possible accident.
He paused on the brink of the stream, and feared to
cross the Rubicon.</p>

<p>"How are you, Tom Thornton?" I exclaimed, after
he had looked about him for the means of bettering
his situation, and of continuing the chase.</p>

<p>The exertions he had made to catch me had evidently
cooled him off in some measure. He was out
of breath, and was apparently becoming "demoralized."
He looked at me, and scowled most unamiably.</p>

<p>"Follow the brook up to the road, and you can
get across there," I added, as he again looked about
him for the means of overcoming his difficulty.</p>

<p>"None of your impudence, you puppy!" replied
he; but his invective was tame compared with what
it had been.</p>

<p>"If I am a puppy, Tom Thornton, perhaps you
would like my bark to cross the brook with," I answered.</p>

<p>"The time to settle up all this business will soon
come," said he, shaking his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Tom Thornton, if you think you can scare
me with any bugbears, you are mistaken. I know
you better than you think I do."</p>

<p>"What do you know?" demanded he, surprised
out of his malignity by my remark.</p>

<p>"What I know I keep to myself. When you go
back to Mrs. Loraine, I wish you would tell her
from me that it won't sound well when it is told
she kept that poor girl shut up in her room for
a week or ten days, with the blinds nailed so that
she could not open them, just because she took
long stitches, or trod on a flower. If I were in
your place I shouldn't like to marry a woman like
that."</p>

<p>Tom looked uneasy, and played with his watch
chain. I thought he wanted to say something conciliatory;
that he desired to extend to me the olive
branch of peace, the better to get me into his power.
I was quite willing to listen to any overtures of this
kind, for I wanted to return to the cottage, obtain
the will and the money, and then bid a final adieu
to Parkville until I had solved the problem of my
existence. I was fearfully anxious lest my uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
should discover the loss of the valuable document
I had taken, and it should be found where I had
concealed it.</p>

<p>"Ernest, you are getting yourself into trouble," said
Tom, after a while, in milder tones than he had yet
used.</p>

<p>"For which, no doubt, you are very sorry," I
added.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't want to quarrel with you."</p>

<p>"You have been very mild and gentle to me."</p>

<p>"Well, I was mad, Ernest," said he, with something
like a smile. "If you will tell me where my
horse is, we will call it all square."</p>

<p>"I told uncle Amos where he is. I left him down
in Welch's Lane."</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"Your father knows where it is. His horse is harnessed,
and he will drive you down there," I replied,
hoping they would adopt my plan, and thus enable
me to enter my chamber and reclaim the valuables
I had left there.</p>

<p>"Very well; I will do so. I will help you put
the plank across the brook before I go," he replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I thank you. I can put it across myself
when I get ready to do so," I answered, cautiously.</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of anything; but I'm not going to
put my head in the wildcat's mouth."</p>

<p>"I won't touch you."</p>

<p>"I don't intend you shall. Go and get your horse,
and I will take care of myself."</p>

<p>"Well, I will."</p>

<p>He turned, and walked up the path towards the
cottage. Of course I had no faith in his word, and I
determined to keep at a respectful distance from him.
When he had disappeared in the grove beyond the
brook, I raised the plank on one end, and then
dropped it across the stream, restoring the bridge
to its original position. I crossed the brook, and
walked towards the house. When I came in sight
of it, the buggy was leaving the yard. I concluded
Tom and his father had really adopted my suggestion,
and were going to Welch's Lane for the horse
and chaise. But I was too wary to advance without
reconnoitring the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your breakfast is all ready, Ernest," said old Betsey,
the housekeeper, as I approached the back door.</p>

<p>"Where are my uncle and the gentleman?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"They told me they were going down to Parkville,
and I need not wait breakfast for them."</p>

<p>I went into the dining-room and sat down at the
table, as much for the purpose of getting something
for Kate as to eat myself. I was scarcely seated,
when I was thrown over backwards, chair and all,
and found myself lying on the floor, held down by
Tom Thornton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST STRIKES A HEAVY BLOW FOR
LIBERTY.</h3>


<div class='cap'>DEAR me! Good gracious! Why!" screamed
Betsey, when Tom Thornton threw me upon
the floor. "I thought you'd gone off with Mr.
Thornton. What in the world are you going to do?
Let the poor boy alone!"</div>

<p>Betsey did not think I was having fair play, and
old and stiff as she was, she rushed up to Tom,
apparently with the intention of interfering.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, old woman!" growled Tom.
"Go and get me a rope."</p>

<p>"A rope! I won't get you any rope! And if
you don't let the poor boy alone, I'll go out and
call the neighbors," replied Betsey, bustling about
the room as though she intended to do some desperate
thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>For my own part, I felt that it would be useless
for me to resist. Tom was strong, and I was wholly
in his power&mdash;taken by surprise, and at a disadvantage
which I could not overcome. I lay still, therefore,
and thus saved some hard knocks.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the poor boy?
He shan't be treated so!" persisted Betsey, who
had not talked so much before for ten years.</p>

<p>"Be still, old woman! He's a bad boy. He stole
my horse, and ran away with a little girl. I shall
not hurt him if he behaves himself," replied Tom,
who appeared to be afraid she would call in some
person to take my part.</p>

<p>"You act like a brute. You treat him worse than
an ox," continued Betsey.</p>

<p>"Now get up, sir," said Tom to me, still retaining
his hold upon my coat collar.</p>

<p>He helped me to my feet. Being vanquished, I
had nothing to say, and I uttered no complaint.
When I rose, he tied my hands behind me with
his handkerchief. I submitted because it would have
been folly for me to resist; but I intended to watch
my opportunity, and submit no longer than necessity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
compelled me to do so. My brutal conqueror took
me by the collar, led me into the hall, and thence
into the cellar. In one corner there was a kind of
closet partitioned off with brick walls, which had
been built for a milk-room; but as my uncle kept
but one cow, it was seldom used. There was no
window in it, and a more damp, dark, and disagreeable
dungeon it would be difficult for a boy of sixteen
to imagine. It had a heavy wooden door, and
altogether the place looked as hopeless as it was
gloomy.</p>

<p>Tom led me up to the door and thrust me in,
with my hands still tied behind me. The only ray
of hope I could obtain was derived from the fact
that there was no lock on the door.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Ernest Thornton, it is my turn," said
Tom, as he partially closed the door of my cell, and
gazed in upon me. "You are a smart boy, but you
have rather overdone it this time. I told you in the
beginning that I was not to be trifled with. You
begin to believe what I said by this time. Have
you anything to say before I close the door?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"A couple of days in this place will bring you to
your senses," added Tom, malignantly.</p>

<p>I made no reply. I did not feel like talking. I
was busy thinking how I should recover the ground
I had lost. I saw that the cellar wall was not laid
in mortar, except two or three feet at the top and
above the ground. I had already made up my mind
that this wall would begin to come down as soon
as I was left alone.</p>

<p>While I was looking at the situation, old Betsey&mdash;whom
I had never suspected of having the least
interest in me&mdash;tottered down the cellar stairs, and
protested that I should not be confined in such a
place. Tom told her it was her employer's orders,
and drove her out of the cellar. I was satisfied that
the old housekeeper was not a party to the deceit
by which I had been lured into the trap. My uncle
told her that he and Tom were going to Parkville
after the horse, as Betsey explained to me afterwards,
bidding her call me to breakfast, that I might
not be late to school. This was Tom's plan to insnare
me, and during this time he was in the cellar,
preparing the dungeon for my reception. My uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and old Jerry had gone in the buggy after Tom's
horse and chaise.</p>

<p>"Ernest, I am willing to make terms with you
now," said Tom, after he had got rid of Betsey. "I
came over here after that girl. You say you know
where she is. If you will tell me where I can find
her, I will not shut you up. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"No!" I answered, as decidedly as I could speak
the word.</p>

<p>"Think well of it. If I can't find her with your
help, I shall find her without it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will."</p>

<p>"The Hale boy was with you. I shall have him
arrested at once by the sheriff."</p>

<p>"Bob Hale don't know where the girl is. If he
did, he wouldn't tell. When you arrest him, he can
tell a good story about Mrs. Loraine's motherly care
of Kate."</p>

<p>Tom bit his lips; he had no more idea of arresting
Bob than he had of arresting me.</p>

<p>"Once more, before I shut you up, will you tell
me where the girl is, or not?"</p>

<p>"I will not! I will rot in this hole before I will
tell a word about the girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>He slammed the door upon me, and I was in utter
darkness. I heard him putting props against the
door, and pounding them down so as to make it secure.
Then all was still outside, and I concluded
that he had gone up stairs. I had a faint hope that
old Betsey would come down and release me; but I
immediately went to work upon the handkerchief
which confined my hands.</p>

<p>My captor had crossed my wrists and tied them
together in this position. I twisted and wrenched
till I stretched the linen of the handkerchief, and
strained the knot enough to permit me to pull my
hands through my bonds, and free them. The darkness
was gloomy and oppressive, even after I had
been only half an hour in the dungeon. I felt that,
for Kate's sake, as well as my own, I must get out.
For the present she was safe, for Tom had destroyed
the skiff, so that he could not go out to the Splash;
but the poor girl would suffer agonies of terror if I
did not go to her in the course of the day.</p>

<p>I was almost furious when I thought of my situation;
of Kate in the cuddy of the boat, and of the
will and money in the closet. I was afraid my uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
would discover his loss before I could escape. I
could hardly keep from weeping with vexation as I
thought of my misfortune. But it was not my style
to groan long over my mishaps, when there was a
chance, however desperate, of retrieving them. I was
determined either to break my way out of my prison,
or convince my jailer it was not strong enough
to hold me.</p>

<p>I felt of the stones that formed the wall, and
pulled out as many of the small ones as were loose
enough to permit their removal. I then used my
strength on a dozen of the larger ones, till I found
one which could be taken out. How I wished then
for an iron bar! With such an implement I felt that
I could soon let in the daylight. But I had no bar,
and after removing one stone about the size of my
head, I was utterly unable to start another around it.</p>

<p>I was perplexed. I felt in my pockets for something
to help me. I don't know but I had a faint
hope of finding an iron bar; but certainly there was
none there, or anything else with which I could operate
on the obdurate stone wall. In my perplexity,
I "fished my pockets" thoroughly. In the usual assortment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a boy carries with him, I had a quantity of
matches. I was not a smoker, but I always found it
convenient to have a match when I happened to be
out after dark in the Splash, to light my cabin lantern.</p>

<p>These matches were suggestive, for the door of my
prison was made of wood, and fire would consume
and destroy it. There were several shelves across
the end of my dungeon, one of which I pulled down,
and with my knife proceeded to whittle off the shavings
for a fire. While I was thus engaged, I heard
a vehicle drive up to the door. It was immediately
followed by another, and I concluded that my uncle
had returned. I had made a large pile of shavings.
I then went to work on the lower part of the door,
cutting into it, and roughening the boards, so that
the fire could be readily communicated to it.</p>

<p>Having completed my preparations, I lighted a
match, and set fire to the shavings. They were
rather damp, and it was some time before I could
get up a free fire. I moved the combustibles against
the door; but the wood was saturated with moisture,
and I was almost suffocated by the smoke, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the door appeared to be only charred by the heat
of the fire. While I was busily engaged in this
effort, the props were removed, and the door thrown
open. My uncle rushed forward and stamped out
the fire I had kindled.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Ernest?" gasped my uncle.</p>

<p>"Working my way out of this hole," I replied.</p>

<p>"There, Thomas, you can see what the boy is,"
groaned my uncle. "But he shall not be kept in such
a place as this."</p>

<p>"Very well, governor," said Tom, who had followed
his father. "Put him into his chamber."</p>

<p>My captor came forward, and taking me by the
collar, led me out of my dungeon. He had a club
in his hand, and assured me if I made any resistance,
he would hit me on the head with it. Deeming it
prudent to be submissive, I permitted him to conduct
me to my chamber. The blinds were closed,
and I saw that the room had been prepared for my
reception. It afterwards came to my knowledge that
my uncle positively refused to permit me to be confined
in the cellar; and they had nailed up the windows
and the blinds before they removed me to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
new prison. I was locked in, after old Betsey had
placed on the table food enough for my breakfast
and dinner.</p>

<p>My uncle was human. After all the wrongs he
and his graceless son had inflicted on me, he was not
willing that I should be injured. I had always
thought he hated me, but compared with Tom, his
feelings were tender and fatherly. The first thing I
did when I was left alone was to assure myself that
the valuables in the closet were safe. They were
just where I had left them, for my uncle had been
too busy to open his strong box.</p>

<p>I ate my breakfast, and then dressed myself in my
best clothes, ready for my final departure, for a window-sash
and a pair of blinds could not keep me. I
marvelled that my jailers expected to confine me in
my chamber; but I concluded that they were on the
watch below ready to check any movement I might
make. I examined the windows, and found they
were nailed down on the outside. My fowling-piece,
fishing-rods, and other articles which could be used
as offensive weapons, were removed from the room.</p>

<p>It was necessary that I should strike and run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
within the same moment. I wanted a battering-ram,
with which to smash the window and the blind.
With the bed-key, which was in the closet, I took
down the bedstead as quietly as I could. Reserving
one side piece for use, I placed the rest against the
door, so that it could not be opened. I then put the
will and the money into my pocket, and filled a
napkin with food for Kate. A few quick and vigorous
blows with the side piece of the bedstead reduced
the window and the blinds to a wreck, and I
leaped out upon the roof of the library, just as I
heard my persecutors at the door of the chamber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST MAKES GOOD HIS RETREAT FROM
THE COTTAGE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WITHOUT remorse, I glanced behind me at
the wreck I had made of the window. I
did not regard myself as responsible for any damage
I had caused in breaking away from my persecutors.
Not only Tom, but my uncle, was engaged in a conspiracy
against me, in which they had been concerned
from my early childhood. Indeed, I had already come
to the conclusion that the cottage and grounds had
been purchased with money which rightfully belonged
to me.</div>

<p>Judging from the conversations to which I had listened,
detached and indefinite as they were, I was
satisfied that my uncle and his son intended to cheat
me out of my birthright, and out of the inheritance
my father had left for me. But this was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
compared with the statement of my uncle that my
mother was insane, and the fact that I was not permitted
to know even where she was. I began to
doubt whether she was insane, or had ever been. It
was possible that my uncle, to obtain his brother's
property, had confined her in a lunatic asylum on a
mere pretence. My blood boiled with indignation as
I thought of these things, and I did not wonder that
my uncle could not sleep nights, that he was a misanthrope,
and hated the sound of his own and of
other people's voices.</p>

<p>With such provocation I could have justified myself
in smashing all the windows in the cottage, or
even in burning the house to the ground. I thanked
God that I had escaped, when I stood upon the
roof; and without the loss of a moment, I made my
way to the ground. I caught one glance of Tom's
face as he came to the window before my descent.
But he was active and resolute, and almost as soon
as I reached the ground, he had descended the stairs,
and passed out upon the lawn in front of the house.</p>

<p>There was nothing more at the cottage for me,
and now all I wanted was to get on board of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Splash. My skiff was destroyed, and my pursuer
would not permit me to build a raft. I could have
swum off to her; but the water might injure, if not
ruin, the priceless document in my pocket. Tom was
at my heels, and all I could do was to run.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted Tom.</p>

<p>I ran all the faster when the sound of his voice
assured me how near he was.</p>

<p>"Stop! If you don't stop, I'll shoot you!" cried he.</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder, and saw that he had
my fowling-piece in his hand; at least there was no
other gun about the place. But I was not much
alarmed by the threat, for the gun had not been
used for months, and I did not believe it was in condition
to go off. The wretch expected to frighten
me by this demonstration; but if he had had a
twenty-four pounder, loaded with grape, it would
not have stopped me till the shot struck me.</p>

<p>Tom slackened his pace and raised the gun to his
shoulder, threatening again to shoot me if I did not
stop. The trick only gave me the advantage, for I
gained several rods while he was making the feint
with the gun. I reached the foot-bridge over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
brook, and, profiting by my former experience, I
adopted the same course again. I had just time to
drag <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the the'">the</ins> plank over the stream when my pursuer
reached the opposite bank. I felt that I was
safe now; and, out of breath with my exertions, I
did not hurry myself.</p>

<p>"Will you stop, or shall I send a bullet after you?"
shouted Tom; and I could easily imagine the chagrin
with which he again found his progress checked.</p>

<p>I made no reply, but continued on my way down
the path. I did not lose any time, for it was possible
that he might, in his desperation, wade across the
stream, and follow up the pursuit. Some distance
behind him, I saw my uncle hastening to the spot
with what speed he could command. I was satisfied
with myself. I had fought a hard battle with my
enemy, but I had won the victory.</p>

<p>A little way beyond the brook I came to the fence
that divided my uncle's estate from that of his nearest
neighbor. I leaped over, and continued my walk
till I came to the house of Mr. Van Wort. He was
a farmer, and had two grown-up sons, one of whom
kept a small flat-boat for fishing and gunning purposes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I saw the owner of the boat hoeing in the
garden. Though I was hardly acquainted with him,
I went to him and asked if he would lend me
his boat for half an hour. I found he was a crabbed
fellow, and was not disposed to oblige me. I told
him that I was in a great hurry, that my own skiff
was broken, and if he would lend me his I would give
him a dollar for the use of her. The dollar opened
his eyes and his heart, if he had any. He consented
to the bargain, and I paid him in advance, telling
him I would push the skiff ashore when I was done
with her, for I could not land in the Splash. He
promised to be on the lookout for her, brought the
oars from the barn, and I pushed off.</p>

<p>I had pulled but a short distance when I discovered
Tom and my uncle walking along the path by
the side of the lake. They had crossed the brook,
Tom having probably waded over, and restored the
plank for his father to go over upon. I paid no attention
to them, though Tom repeatedly shouted to
me. They retraced their steps as I rowed along the
shore; but they were powerless to injure me while
the deep waters of the lake lay between us. I reached
the Splash, and went on board of her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Loraine. How do you do?"
I said, going to the cuddy.</p>

<p>"Nicely, I thank you," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"Have you been comfortable in your cabin?"</p>

<p>"Very; as nice as a bug in a rug. But I was
afraid something had happened, as you did not come
off as soon as I expected."</p>

<p>"Something has happened; but you are safe, at
any rate," I added. "We will talk about that by
and by. Will you hand me the tiller, if you please?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is," said she, laughing; and
everything appeared to be sunshine with her. "Here
is the key; you can open the door."</p>

<p>She handed it to me through one of the ventilators,
and I unlocked the door.</p>

<p>"Don't show yourself, Kate; for we are closely
watched," I added, as I took the tiller from the
cuddy. "Tom Thornton is on the shore with my
uncle. Don't let him see you."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed she, crouching down in the
berth, as if afraid he would look through the side of
the boat.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed. There is no danger. The wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
is fresh, and he could not catch us, even if he had a
boat. Here is some breakfast for you," I continued,
handing her a napkin in which I had enclosed the
provision sent up for my dinner in my chamber.</p>

<p>I hoisted the fore and main sails of the boat, and
slipping the mooring, ran up the jib. I stood over
to the Van Wort place, and after going as near the
shore as the depth of water would permit, I headed
the skiff to the bank, and gave it a smart push, which
drove it far enough upon the beach to hold it, just
as the owner of it came to receive it. Trimming the
sails, I went down the lake close-hauled.</p>

<p>Kate was eating her breakfast, and I was glad to
be alone with my own thoughts for a time. My uncle
and Tom still stood on the shore in front of the
cottage, watching me. I wanted to mature my plans.
I intended to go to New York with Kate, and help
her find her uncle. There was a railroad station at
Cannondale, and another at the head of Adieno Creek.
It would be safer for us to take the train at the latter
station. Tom Thornton would do something. He
would not stay another hour at the cottage. He had
money enough and energy enough to cause me a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
great deal of trouble. I had no doubt that he would
procure a whole fleet of boats to pursue me. He
would even charter the Champion steamer, if he could
get her.</p>

<p>I had already studied the railroad time tables, and
as it was now after ten in the forenoon, there would
be no train along the south shore till between three
and four in the afternoon; and Tom would have
abundance of time to carry out any plan he might
devise. I did not wish to leave Parkville without
seeing Bob Hale. He had been my friend and confidant,
and I might not see him again for weeks, or
even months. I might meet him at recess at the Institute,
and I concluded to do so.</p>

<p>Just then it occurred to me that if I went off with
Kate, I should leave Bob a legacy of trouble and
confusion. When I disappeared, Tom would go to
my friend, and harass him, perhaps cause his arrest.
I was not willing to allow this if it could possibly
be avoided. It would be better and fairer for me to
settle all this business with Tom before I left. He
still stood on the shore with his father, and I supposed
he was watching to see where I went, hoping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that my movements would give him a clew to the
hiding-place of Kate. I put the Splash about, and
headed her towards the cottage.</p>

<p>"Kate," I called to her, "you may come out now,
if you like."</p>

<p>"Is it safe to do so? If it isn't, I had just as lief
stay in here," she replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will think I am crazy, Kate; but I
wish to have Tom Thornton see you;" and I proceeded
to explain the difficulty under which poor
Bob would labor after our departure.</p>

<p>"I shall do just what you tell me, Ernest Thornton,
if it is to jump overboard" replied she, coming
out of the cabin, and taking a seat on the weather
side of the boat.</p>

<p>With the wind nearly aft, the Splash dashed forward
on her course. I ran her up within twenty
yards of the shore, where Tom and my uncle stood,
and then threw her up into the wind.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tom Thornton," I shouted, "I want you to
understand that Miss Loraine has been on board of
my boat all night."</p>

<p>It must have been a great satisfaction to him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
know that he had been within a stone's throw of her
ever since his arrival at the cottage.</p>

<p>"Bring her ashore, you villain!" cried he, stamping
his feet with rage and vexation.</p>

<p>"You smashed my skiff so that I can't land here,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"Ernest, will you hear me?" called uncle Amos,
as the Splash filled away again.</p>

<p>"I came up here to let you know that Bob Hale
hasn't anything to do with this business," I shouted.</p>

<p>The boat was receding from the shore, and nothing
more could be said. I saw that both Tom's and
my uncle's horses were harnessed, and standing at
the front door of the house. I watched them closely,
and presently they got into their respective vehicles,
and drove off.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST OBTAINS SOME VALUABLE LETTERS.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WHAT will they do?" asked Kate, trembling
with fear, when I told her my uncle and
Tom had driven off.</div>

<p>"I don't know; that is what I would like to
ascertain," I replied, considering the circumstances
which presented themselves. "If they were going
to the same place, they would have taken the same
vehicle. It is about fifteen miles round by the road
to Cannondale. I think one of them must have
gone that way. About two miles below, the road
lies near the lake, and I will run down where I can
see which of them goes in that direction."</p>

<p>"I am terribly frightened, Ernest Thornton," said
my fair passenger, after I had headed the Splash in
the direction indicated.</p>

<p>"I cannot deny, Kate, that we are both in great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
danger of being captured; but I shall do the best I
can, and we can only hope that it will come out
right in the end. Tom Thornton will do everything
that mortal man can do to catch us."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are doing too much for me, Ernest
Thornton. You will get yourself into trouble,"
she added, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, Kate. I think Tom
Thornton has a stronger desire to capture me now
than he has you. We are both in the same boat in
a double sense. I will tell you all about it by and
by. I must keep my eyes wide open now. Of
course Tom knows you have an uncle in New
York."</p>

<p>"I suppose he does."</p>

<p>"Then he will readily understand that you intend
to reach him if you can."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Loraine would think so, I know, for she
burned the letter I wrote to my uncle."</p>

<p>"There goes Tom Thornton's chaise," said I, pointing
to the vehicle, as we reached a part of the lake
which commanded a view of the road. "He has
stopped to watch the boat. I know where he is
going now, and that's enough."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"What will you do?" asked Kate, fixing the gaze
of her deep-blue eyes upon me.</p>

<p>"I hardly know. I confess that my plans are not
arranged yet, and everything depends upon circumstances.
I am going up to the Institute now to find
Bob Hale, if I can."</p>

<p>"Will that be safe?"</p>

<p>"I think it will. No boat on the lake can catch
the Splash in this breeze; and Bob may be able to
help me."</p>

<p>In half an hour we were off the Institute pier;
but the recess was over, and the students were all
in the school-room. It was not safe for me to remain
long in this vicinity, for my uncle had by this
time reached Parkville, and had probably employed
some one to pursue me. I wrote a note to Bob
with pencil, on a slip of paper I had in my pocket,
and running the Splash up to the pier, sent it to
the school-room by one of the men who was at
work in the garden. My friend appeared immediately.</p>

<p>"Come on board, Bob. I have a great deal to
say to you, and only a little time to say it in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is school time," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"I must not stop here a moment. I am going off,
Bob, and may never see you again, at least not for
some time."</p>

<p>"Why, what's up, Ernest?" he asked, as he
stepped on board, his scruples removed by the announcement
I had made.</p>

<p>"A great deal has happened since we parted last
night," I replied, pushing off the Splash from the
pier.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Loraine?" continued Bob.
"I am glad to see you are still safe."</p>

<p>"I am very well, thanks to Ernest Thornton," she
replied.</p>

<p>I headed the boat up the lake towards the cottage
again, and proceeded to tell Bob all that had
happened since midnight. He listened in amazement
to my story. I showed him my father's will, which
I had not yet read, and we went through it together.</p>

<p>"It is very plain that they mean to cheat you out
of the property your father left for you," said he.</p>

<p>"That is clear enough. My uncle told me nearly
a year ago that my father left nothing for me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems that your father died in England,"
added Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes; in London. This will names my mother as
my guardian, and my uncle Amos as the trustee, to
take care of the property, which, it seems, was all in
stocks and bonds. But my uncle says my mother is
in an insane asylum; but whether in England or the
United States, I don't know," I continued, folding
up the will.</p>

<p>"I don't see how your uncle did it. It is the
most infernal, mean business I ever heard of," said
Bob, indignantly. "But what are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to find my mother!"</p>

<p>"How will you find her? Where will you look
for her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, feeling for the first
time that my information was very insufficient.</p>

<p>"Were there no other papers in the safe?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of them; but I was so agitated I could
not examine them."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do, Ernest?"</p>

<p>"I am going to New York, first; then to Philadelphia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
perhaps, where Tom Thornton lives when
he is at home. I may find out something there."</p>

<p>"But how will you get to New York?"</p>

<p>"My plan was to run up the creek, and take the
train at the Adieno station; but Tom Thornton has
gone over that way, and I am afraid he will have
somebody stationed there and at Cannondale to stop
us. If you could help me, Bob&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help you! certainly I'll help you!" interposed
he, warmly. "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"If you could get a team and drive us over to
Romer, which is about ten miles, we could take the
train there without danger."</p>

<p>"I'll do it."</p>

<p>"And, Bob, you may tell your father the whole
story, and then he won't blame you," I added, not
wishing to get him into a scrape.</p>

<p>"My father is away; but don't worry about me.
You are clearly in the right, and I will do all I can
for you, whatever happens to me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Bob. The time will come when I
shall stand on my feet, and then it will be all right
with you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>I ran the Splash up a small creek on the edge of
the town, and landed Bob. He was to procure a
horse and covered wagon, and take Kate and myself
at the cottage; for, now that Tom and my uncle
were away, it seemed to be the safest place to land.
Besides, I had another object in view in choosing
this locality.</p>

<p>For an hour I cruised about the upper end of the
lake, until I saw Bob wave his handkerchief from
the wagon, near the cottage. I ran the Splash into
the mouth of the brook, which was the only place
where the water was deep enough to permit our
landing. I lowered the sails, and fastened the painter
to a tree. I directed Kate to run through the
grove to the road, where she would find the wagon,
and promised to join her in a few moments. Trembling
with fear, she ran up the hill, and I hastened
to the cottage. My uncle was away, and I was determined
to look at the papers in the safe again, for
I was convinced that I could not find my mother
without more information than I possessed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">ERNEST SURPRISED BY HIS UNCLE.&mdash;Page 139.</span>
</div>

<p>I went directly to the bay window where I had
entered the library before, and effected an entrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
without any difficulty. I found the key of the safe
under the cushion, where I had left it, and opened
the door. Eagerly I seized the pile of papers I had
seen before, and began to examine them. Most of
them were unintelligible to me, and apparently had
no connection with my father's affairs; but there
were several letters dated at London, which I thrust
into my pocket. I could find nothing else which
promised to be of service to me, and I was about to
close the door, when I discovered a sealed letter
lying in a pigeon hole by itself. I took it from its
place, and read the direction: "Robert G. Bunyard,
47 Old Jewry, Chambers, London."</p>

<p>This letter, I was convinced, would afford me some
information; indeed, the address would give me a
clew to what I wanted. I was kneeling on one
knee, with this letter in my hand, when the door of
the library suddenly opened, and my uncle stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>"Ernest Thornton!" cried he, in tones so full of
terror that they pierced my soul.</p>

<p>He sprang towards me; but I stepped out of his
way, though I was nearly paralyzed by this unexpected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
interruption. I thrust the letter into my
pocket, and stood at bay near the window by which
I had entered.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" gasped uncle Amos, as
he staggered towards me, his face pale as a sheet,
and his limbs trembling in every fibre. "What
papers have you taken?"</p>

<p>"My father's will for one," I replied, almost as
much disturbed as he was.</p>

<p>"O Heaven!" groaned he.</p>

<p>"Uncle Amos, will you tell me now where my
mother is?"</p>

<p>"O, Ernest! I am ruined!" exclaimed he, sinking
into a chair.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me where my mother is?" I repeated,
with all the earnestness I could command.</p>

<p>"Is this the return you make to me for all my
kindness to you?" he added, in a choking voice.
"I have given you all you wanted&mdash;boats, money,
everything. Have pity on me, Ernest. I&mdash;I shall&mdash;I
shall go mad!"</p>

<p>"I should think you would," I replied, having in
some degree recovered my self-possession. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
told me my father left nothing for me; that my
mother was in an insane asylum."</p>

<p>"She is, Ernest&mdash;she is," said he.</p>

<p>"Where?" I demanded, in a loud, fierce tone.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. Where is Thomas? Send
for him, and he will make it all right. You shall
have every dollar that belongs to you, Ernest. I
am a miserable wretch; but I did not do this deed
for my own sake. Send for Thomas."</p>

<p>"I have had enough of Thomas. He would cut
my throat as readily as he would turn his hand.
Will you tell me where my mother is, or shall I
find her myself?"</p>

<p>"You cannot find her, Ernest. Be calm, and you
shall have all. Send for Thomas."</p>

<p>"I will not send for him. I don't care so much
for the money as I do for my mother. Tell me
where she is, or send for her."</p>

<p>"She could not come."</p>

<p>"Then I can go to her."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Ernest, and be calm."</p>

<p>"I'm calm enough. I could forgive you for anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
you have done to me. If you will not tell
me where she is, I shall find her myself."</p>

<p>"You cannot find her."</p>

<p>"I can apply to Mr. Robert G. Bunyard&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>My uncle sprang to his feet, uttered a cry of agony,
and attempted to stagger towards me; but his
legs yielded beneath him, and he sank upon the
floor. He had either fainted or fallen in a fit. I
called old Betsey, and she and I placed him on a
sofa. She said he had only fainted, and wanted to
know what had happened. I replied that my uncle
would tell her if he thought best. We bathed his
head and rubbed his temples till he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Send for Thomas," said he, feebly.</p>

<p>I was satisfied that he would recover, and being
perfectly willing Tom should be sent for, I told
Jerry where he could probably be found. I then
left the house by the front door. My uncle's horse
stood at the hitching-post. He had probably employed
some one to follow up the Splash, and then
returned to the house. As I went out, I saw a
large sail-boat standing up the lake, which I concluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was in pursuit of me. Hastening up the
hill, I found Bob greatly alarmed at my long absence.</p>

<p>"I was afraid something had happened to you,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Drive on, and I will tell you about it," I replied,
as I seated myself in the wagon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST LEAVES PARKVILLE, AND TAKES
THE TRAIN FOR THE EASTWARD.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WHAT kept you so long?" asked Bob, when
I was seated. "I was sure something had
gone wrong with you."</div>

<p>"I don't know whether it has gone right or wrong.
I went into the library, and opened the safe again.
While I was looking at the papers, my uncle came in."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Bob. "There was a storm in
the library about that time&mdash;wasn't there?"</p>

<p>"Not much of a storm. I pity my uncle from the
bottom of my heart. He is suffering more than you
can imagine or I can describe, and he has been a
sufferer for years," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say to you?" asked Bob, who
did not seem to be in the humor, at that moment,
for moralizing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>I described the scene which had occurred in the
library as minutely as I could,&mdash;and Kate and Bob
were thrilled by the narrative. For my own part I
had not yet recovered from the shock it had given
me. The expression of agony on my uncle's face
haunted my imagination. I could still see his pale
face and his quivering lip, and his piteous pleading
lingered in my ears. Most terrible are the sufferings
of the evil-doer, and I resolved anew that I would
always be true to God and principle. What were
mines of wealth to a man tortured with the pangs of
remorse?</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any danger that we shall
be pursued?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Not the least," I replied. "I don't think any one
will suspect that we have left town. I believe my
uncle engaged a boatman to pursue the Splash. I
saw a schooner, which I think was the Alert, standing
up the lake, after we had landed. They will find
the Splash in the brook where I left her. Old Jerry
was going over after Tom Thornton, and very likely
he will reach the cottage some time this afternoon.
As it is almost a matter of life and death with him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
no doubt he will follow; but he will be a day behind
us. Now, Bob, I want to look over these
papers, so as to determine what I am to do."</p>

<p>I read my father's will again. It appeared from
this document that he belonged to the city of Philadelphia,
but was temporarily residing in London.
How long he lived there, or for what purpose, I
had no means of knowing. His property, consisting
of stocks, bonds, and other securities, amounted to
over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, the income
of one third of which, after paying legacies, was
placed in trust for the use of my mother during her
lifetime, and two thirds in trust for his son during
his minority. Five thousand dollars was given to his
brother, who was appointed his sole executor and
trustee, with an annuity of fifteen hundred dollars,
payable from the income of the trust funds, during
the minority of his son Ernest; and of five hundred
dollars during the life of his wife, if she survived the
son's maturity. In the event of his wife's decease,
her third was to be held in trust for his son. The
mother was appointed the guardian of the son; and
if the son died before he was twenty-one, then the
property was to go to his brother, "the said Amos."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is rather a mixed-up mess," said I, perplexed
by the contingencies and the repetitions.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Bob, who was more of
a lawyer than I was. "I understand it well enough.
Your father gives your uncle five thousand dollars in
the first place, and then the income of one third to
your mother, and two thirds to you till you are of
age. If your mother is living when you are twenty-one,
your uncle pays you your two thirds; if she is
not living, he is to pay you the whole; and that ends
his connection with the business. He is to have fifteen
hundred dollars a year for taking care of the
property."</p>

<p>"I understand all that," I added.</p>

<p>"The rest of it is clear enough. If your mother
dies before you are twenty-one, all the income goes
to you. Whenever your mother dies, her share goes
to you. If you die before your mother, your share
goes to your uncle; and then your mother's share
goes to him or his heirs at her death. It says at the
end there that your uncle shall not be required to
give bonds for the faithful performance of his duty
under the will. Don't you understand it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I do; at least I understand enough of
it. I would give all the money to know where my
poor mother is. I care more for her than I do for
myself."</p>

<p>"I think you will find her."</p>

<p>"O, I hope you will!" exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"I heard Tom tell my uncle that he had given
him all the money he wanted," I added. "What do
you suppose that means?"</p>

<p>"I suppose your uncle has given up the property
to Tom," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"Tom lives in Philadelphia&mdash;don't he, Kate?"</p>

<p>"I think he does; indeed I am pretty sure of it,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"I can't see how they have managed the business
without discovery. My father must have had some
friends who knew about his affairs."</p>

<p>"And your mother, too," added Bob. "I don't see
through it; but I suppose you will understand it one
of these days."</p>

<p>"Bob, I don't like to carry this will round with
me. I may lose it, or Tom Thornton may get it
away from me. I want you to take it. Give it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
your father, and ask him to keep it safe for me.
And when I want a powerful friend, I shall call upon
him."</p>

<p>"You may be sure he will do all he can for you,"
said Bob, heartily, as he carefully deposited the precious
document in his pocket. "What else have you,
Ernest?"</p>

<p>"Here is a letter directed to 'Robert G. Bunyard,
London,'" I replied, producing it.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't open that yet. What else have
you?"</p>

<p>"Here are half a dozen letters," I added, opening
one of them.</p>

<p>"What does it say?&mdash;read it," said Bob, impatiently.</p>

<p>I read it, and it proved to be an acknowledgment
of the receipt of two hundred pounds, signed by
Bunyard.</p>

<p>Four others were of similar import, and all of them
were dated in different years. The sixth began in
the same manner, acknowledging a like sum of
money. It was dated three years back. I read
aloud, with intense emotion, a few lines that followed
the business matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The poor lady is much more quiet and contented
in her new home than she was at my last writing,
and her physician hopes that she will soon be
quite reconciled. She persists in declaring that she
is entirely well, and wishes to return to America.
She says nothing now about the melancholy death of
her son, and we hope that good nursing and skilful
treatment will eventually restore her, at least, to her
ordinary degree of health.'"</p>

<p>"My poor mother!" I exclaimed, bursting into
tears, and crushing the letter in my hand.</p>

<p>"How sad!" said Kate.</p>

<p>"I must go to her at once! I will find her, if I
have to search through the earth for her!" I ejaculated,
bitterly, as I wiped away my tears. "Did
you think my uncle was such an infernal villain?"</p>

<p>"I did not, Ernest; but don't be distressed about
it. The letter intimates that she is kindly treated."</p>

<p>"I hope she is."</p>

<p>"Have you any more papers, Ernest?" asked Bob,
apparently as much with the intention of turning my
thoughts away from the sad subject which agitated
me, as of gratifying his own curiosity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all, Bob," I replied, taking from my pocket
the piece of newspaper in which I had rolled up the
money I had taken from the safe. "Was it stealing
for me to take this money?" I asked, as I unrolled
the bills.</p>

<p>"I don't think it was," replied Bob. "You took
it to pay your expenses in finding your mother; and,
even if it were a technical theft, I don't think any
one can blame you for what you have done. The
money is really your own. How much is there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't looked at it before."</p>

<p>"Count it, Ernest."</p>

<p>I did so, and was appalled to find I had taken between
fourteen and fifteen hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"All right, Ernest. You are a smart fellow, and
I'll tell you what I should do if I were in your place,"
replied Bob, who did not appear to be alarmed at
the magnitude of the sum.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I would go to England in the very next steamer,
and find my mother."</p>

<p>"Go to England!"</p>

<p>"It is clear enough to me that your mother is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
there. If you expect to find her, you must go
there."</p>

<p>"I will do it, Bob," I replied, excited at the idea
of crossing the ocean in search of my mother.</p>

<p>"Certainly; do it. You have a letter directed to&mdash;what's
his name?"</p>

<p>"Robert G. Bunyard."</p>

<p>"Go to London, find this man, deliver the letter,
and tell him you want to see the poor lady."</p>

<p>"I'll do it. Don't you suppose Tom Thornton will
try to stop me?"</p>

<p>"No matter if he does. Keep a stiff upper lip."</p>

<p>"I shall do that. I have fought my way through
so far, and I shall do it to the end," I replied, confidently.
"It would have been better if I had avoided
that scene with my uncle; but I could not
help it."</p>

<p>"What odds will that make?"</p>

<p>"A great deal of odds. My uncle knows now that
I have the address of his London correspondent. He
will tell Tom about it. My uncle may be full of
regret and sorrow; but his son will follow me like a
bloodhound. But, no matter what happens, Bob, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
shall fight my way through. My poor mother shall
be released from her bondage, and be happy again."</p>

<p>"Right, Ernest!" exclaimed Bob, as he urged forward
the horse.</p>

<p>We rode in silence for several miles; but I was
intensely excited as I thought of what my mother
had endured for a dozen years. I recalled the indistinct
visions of the past, which still lingered in my
mind; and more vividly than ever before it came to
my remembrance that, far back in the past, I had
known a motherly lady, who loved and cherished me
as a little child. The dreary waste of waters which
had lingered in my fancy became a reality to me. I
had crossed the ocean, after the death of my father;
but I did not yet know whether I was born in England
or the United States.</p>

<p>I prayed for my mother; and she seemed more
dear to me than if I had seen her every day of my
life. I prayed that God would spare her, and restore
her to me; that he would crown with success my
exertions to find her. I am sure that, in all my
intense emotion, I did not cherish a sentiment of
revenge towards my uncle, or even towards his son,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
who had treated me like a brute. My silent prayers
warmed my heart, and blessed me with new strength
and courage.</p>

<p>At half past two we drove into Romer. Bob put
up his horse at a stable, and we dined together at a
hotel. At quarter past four, the train going east
arrived; and, bidding Bob an affectionate farewell,
after he had promised to write me the news in Parkville
on his return, Kate and I entered the car, and
were soon whirling away from the town, from friends
and from enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST WONDERS WHAT TOM THORNTON
WILL DO, AND FINDS OUT.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THOUGH I had not travelled much, I felt quite
at home on the train. I was not troubled
with any of that disagreeable quality called "greenness,"
for I had read the newspapers every day regularly
for five years; and, through them, a person
may know the world without seeing much of it.
Besides, nearly all my schoolmates had come from
places more or less distant; and, being of an inquiring
mind, I had "pumped" many of them dry.</div>

<p>With what I had read, with what I had learned
from pictures, maps, and diagrams, and with what
my friends had told me while we were sailing in
the Splash, I had a tolerably correct idea of the city
of New York. I was very much surprised, when I
arrived there, to find how familiar the streets were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to me. I had pored for hours at a time over the
street maps of the cities in Colton's Atlas; I had
walked in imagination through the streets of London
and Paris; and I had read the encyclop&aelig;dia, and all
the books of travel which came in my way.</p>

<p>After this course of study, I was not burdened
with "greenness." I felt at home; and, though I
looked with interest upon scenes and objects that
were new to me, I did not keep my mouth wide open,
or stare like an idiot. I take all this pains to prove
that I was not green, because I had an especial horror
of verdancy in general, and verdant boys in particular.
I kept myself cool and self-possessed, and I
was delighted to find that no one looked at me, or
appeared to think I was ill at ease.</p>

<p>I was dressed in my best clothes, and though they
were made by a provincial tailor, Parkville was progressive
enough to boast of a genuine artist in this
line. There was nothing about my companion, any
more than myself, to attract attention. Doubtless
most of the people thought we were brother and
sister, or that some elderly gentleman and lady, seated
in another part of the car, would claim us when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
we reached our destination. I suppose I thought of
all these things because I feared that some one was
looking at me, and because I had an especial dread
of being noticed at that time.</p>

<p>Even Bob Hale, partial as he was, and sympathizing
with me to the fullest extent, could not deny
that I had been guilty of what he called "technical
theft." In the very worst possible phase in
which it could be viewed, I had robbed my uncle's
safe of nearly fifteen hundred dollars, and I had the
money in my pocket. I was liable, therefore, to be
arrested at any moment when the intelligence of my
constructive crime should be forwarded to the proper
officers, or whenever a deputy sheriff from Parkville
could overtake me.</p>

<p>My conscience did not then, and it does not now,
accuse me of the crime of theft. That money was
really mine, though, if it had been applied or invested
by my legal trustee, in accordance with the
law, and the last will of my father, I should have
had no more right to touch it than if it had belonged
to another person. My uncle and his graceless
son were engaged in a scheme to rob me. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
latter wished to destroy the will at once,&mdash;supposed
it had already been done,&mdash;while the former, from
simply prudential motives, preserved it. In his own
words, he dared not burn it. He evidently kept it
that it might open an avenue of escape in case his
vicious plan miscarried. After I had been disposed
of, sent off and had "lost the run" of my uncle,
the document could be destroyed. I felt, therefore,
that I was fully justified in using enough of the
money, at least, to enable me to obtain justice.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock in the evening when the train
arrived at Albany. We could go no farther that
night, and I felt the awkwardness of my situation.
I did not like to go to a hotel with Kate Loraine;
and, leaving her in the ladies' room at the railroad
station, I looked about the premises till I found a
respectable-looking baggage-master, whom I asked to
direct me to a good boarding-house. He gave me
the street and number of one he could recommend,
and I called a carriage, which conveyed us to the
place indicated. It was kept by a very worthy old
lady, who fortunately had two vacant rooms, though
she seemed to be suspicious, and hesitated about
taking us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked she, bluntly, as she surveyed
me from head to foot.</p>

<p>"My name is Ernest Thornton. This young lady's
name is Kate Loraine. She is going to her uncle's
in New York. I was recommended to stop at your
house, and I have money enough to pay for all we
have," I replied, as squarely as I could speak, and
telling as much of the truth as it was important for
the old lady to know.</p>

<p>"How long do you want to stop?" she asked,
apparently satisfied with my reply.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. I shall be able to tell you
to-morrow," I answered, for I had some doubts
whether I should leave the next day.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I can keep you," said she.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Have you had any supper?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, we have not."</p>

<p>I paid the hackman, who stood with the valise I
had bought in Romer for Kate, in his hand, and he
departed. I don't know whether any one thought
we were runaways or not. We were safe for the
present. The old lady showed us our rooms, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
then went to get us some supper. I sat down in
my chamber to think over the situation. I was not
quite satisfied, and of course I wished to keep out of
trouble just as long as I could.</p>

<p>By this time Tom Thornton had probably reached
the cottage of his father, and had learned what had
happened. My uncle had told him that I had obtained
the precious will&mdash;that the charter of their
villany was gone. He had found that "that boy"
was not to be trifled with. "That boy" had possessed
himself of the fearful secret of their evil practices,
had probed the mystery of their iniquity, and
was ready to come down upon them like an avenging
spirit, to expose their rascality, and to publish to the
world the story of their infamy.</p>

<p>How mad, vexed, overwhelmed Tom was I could
easily imagine. He had no more soul than a brickbat,
and without a doubt had heaped abuse upon his
father, had berated him for not burning the will, and
for permitting me, by his weak fears, to be a bombshell
in their path so long. Before I knew who
Tom was, I had heard hard words pass between
them. I now supposed he was angry because my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
uncle would not "dispose" of me in some manner
which he proposed.</p>

<p>Tom Thornton and his father had discovered that
the evil man shall not prosper in his way; the sword
of retribution was hanging over them, and their cherished
scheme was crumbling to pieces. My uncle
was in despair, as he had been when I left him.
Piteously he had begged of me to be merciful to
him; and if he had told me where my mother was,
and promised to do justice to her, I am sure I could
not have gone another step to expose him. But my
uncle was an old man&mdash;if not in years, at least in
sorrow and suffering. For years he had been pursued
by the terrors of a guilty conscience; had been
in an agony of doubt and fear, if not of remorse.
He was broken down, had lost his courage, and
there was nothing to fear from him.</p>

<p>Tom was a different person. He was bold and
daring. He had no conscience, and apparently no
fears. He was young and vigorous, strong-minded
and reckless. For years he had been living like a
nabob upon the income of the property which my
father had left for me. He had been swimming in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
luxury, driving his span, and spending half his time
in winning the favor of the fair widow Loraine,
whose fortune, if not Kate's, he intended to add to
his own ill-gotten wealth. Tom Thornton would not
resign his possession of the property, and his bright
prospects of the future, without a terrible struggle,
and I was quite confident that I should have to
fight a grim battle with him.</p>

<p>What would he do? That was the vital question
with me. As the prudent general endeavors to anticipate
the purposes of the enemy, I tried to measure
the probable intentions of Tom Thornton. What
would he do? Would he have me arrested as a
criminal for robbing my uncle's safe? I confess that
the cold sweat stood upon my brow as I thought
of it; as I considered what an awful thing it would
be to be carried back to Parkville by an officer, and
sent to the common jail. But, perhaps, if this were
done, it would be the best thing that could possibly
happen to me.</p>

<p>If arrested and tried, I should have the privilege
of the meanest criminal to defend myself. I should
call on Squire Hale to produce my father's will. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
should lay bare in a court of justice the whole of
Tom's and his father's infamous conduct. But Tom
knew that I had taken the will; that I had deprived
him of his sheet anchor. With only half an eye he
could see what the consequence of arresting me
must be. My uncle would groan and tremble at
the very idea of such an exposure. After these reflections,
I came to the conclusion that I should not
be arrested as a criminal. Tom Thornton would
fight his battle with other weapons than those of
justice and the law.</p>

<p>Tom had shown by his acts that he did not scruple
to take the law into his own hands, and I was
convinced that my future trials were to be caused by
individual persecution rather than public prosecution.
Again the question came up, What will he do? It
was certain that he would follow me, and it was
almost as certain that he would find me. I had
hardly a doubt that he would take the night train
from the west, and be in Albany the next morning.
Such a person as Tom Thornton must be a selfish
man, and I concluded that he would not trouble
himself much more about finding Kate. His own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
trials overshadowed those of the fair widow of Cannondale.
He would be after me rather than Kate.</p>

<p>While I was anxiously considering the case, the
landlady called me to supper. She poured out the
tea, and asked more questions than I cared to answer;
but so far as I said anything, I told the truth.
I did not sleep many hours that night; I was too
much disturbed by the perils of my situation to slumber.
I thought, and thought, and thought. Tom
Thornton would arrive in the morning. At the railroad
station he would begin his inquiries for me.
The baggage-master, who had directed me to the
boarding-house, would tell him just where I was.</p>

<p>I had almost made up my mind to leave Kate in
Albany, go to New York alone, find her uncle, and
then return for her; but the thought that Tom
would arrive in the morning caused me to abandon
this plan. I rose very early, and walked down to
the river, where I found a steamer would leave for
New York at eight o'clock. I went back to the
boarding-house, and after breakfast paid the bill. We
walked down to the river, and went on board of
the steamer. I took a seat where I could see everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that came on board of the boat, for I felt very
certain that Tom Thornton was already in the city,
and searching for me. I was not wrong, for just
as the boat was on the point of starting, and I was
congratulating myself on the fact that we were safe,
I saw him standing on the wharf, looking at me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST FACES THE ENEMY.</h3>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;HAD discovered what Tom Thornton intended
to do, in part. It was not an officer who came
to arrest me; it was Tom himself. Though I had
confidently expected him&mdash;as we always dread the
worst possible thing that can happen to us&mdash;I had
hoped to escape him when the bell sounded for the
departure of the steamer. I felt quite sure that all
was well with me, and had begun to congratulate
myself on my singular good fortune, when his ugly
face appeared on the wharf.</div>

<p>I do not think now that I made any mistake in
not remaining in Albany, for it was the easiest thing
in the world for him to trace me out, and find the
boarding-house where I had spent the night. If I
had left the cars at the last station before the train
reached Albany, I might have avoided him. It seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to me that my only way was to continue the journey,
and I did so. If I had been alone it would have
been an easy matter to evade him.</p>

<p>Tom Thornton rushed on board of the steamer just
in season to secure his passage, for the plank was
hauled on board the moment he had crossed it. I
was on the hurricane deck when I saw him, and he
saw me. Perhaps there was a chance for me yet to
outflank him. It was a bad scrape, but all I could
do was to make the best of it. I left my position
when I saw Tom coming on board, and went to Kate,
whom I had requested to remain in the saloon. I
sat down by her side, and tried to look as unmoved
as I could.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Kate," I began.</p>

<p>"Frightened! Of course I am not frightened
now," she replied, fixing the gaze of her deep eyes
upon me.</p>

<p>"But you musn't be when I tell you something."</p>

<p>"What, Ernest Thornton?" demanded she, taking
the alarm at once.</p>

<p>"Tom Thornton is on board of this steamer.
Don't be alarmed; I will take care of you. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
shall not harm you, and he shall not take you
away from me."</p>

<p>"O mercy!" exclaimed she, turning as white as a
sheet.</p>

<p>"Don't be disturbed, Kate. I think I can take
care of him," I added, with more confidence than I
felt.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet, but I will see. Leave it all
to me, Kate. If he speaks to you, answer him
civilly."</p>

<p>"I could not speak to him. I shall faint away if
he comes near me. O, Ernest Thornton, I am frightened
almost to death!"</p>

<p>"There is no need of your being alarmed. I don't
think he desires to see you half so much as he does
me. I will put you in a safe place soon. Come
down into the ladies' cabin for the present."</p>

<p>She followed me, trembling in every fibre of her
frame. I left her at the door, bidding her keep out
of sight as much as possible. A glance along the
main deck, in the vicinity of the captain's office, assured
me Tom was not there and I procured a state-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the clerk. Going half way up the stairs to
the saloon, I discovered my pursuer. He was evidently
looking for me. I watched him till he had made
the circuit of the long apartment, carefully avoiding
him. He then went below, to look for me in other
parts of the boat. He walked forward first, and I
took this opportunity to conduct Kate to the saloon
again, and gave her the state-room I had procured,
telling her to lock herself in.</p>

<p>"Won't he find me here?" asked she, with quivering
lips.</p>

<p>"No matter if he does: keep your door locked. I
will knock four times by two's. Don't open the door
on any account till you hear my rap."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"I will keep watch on the outside. Now don't be
alarmed. I will take good care of you."</p>

<p>She closed the door, and I heard her lock it. I
felt then that she, at least, was out of Tom's reach
for a time, and that I was in condition to fight the
battle alone. Large as the steamer was, it was impossible
for me to avoid a meeting with him, since
he knew that I was on board. If he had not seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
me the case would have been different, and I might
have contrived to keep out of his way.</p>

<p>I could not help asking myself what I should do.
I did not expect Tom would resort to violence in
the presence of hundreds of passengers. He would
fasten himself upon me, and not lose sight of me.
If he had intended to arrest me, he would have sent
a sheriff after me, instead of coming himself. What
would he do next? This was the important question.
Of course I could not answer it. I could only
wait for time and circumstances to develop his plan.
As it was useless for me to attempt to avoid him, I
sat down in the saloon, resolved to let things take
their course.</p>

<p>Summoning to my aid all the coolness, self-possession,
and impudence I could command,&mdash;and I found
that for an emergency in which I had right and justice
on my side, I had an abundant supply of this
kind of ammunition,&mdash;I calmly waited the appearance
of my adversary. I deliberately made up my
mind to speak up like a man to him, and to stand my
ground like a hero. If he made a scene, I would denounce
him, and punch him with the naked truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Thornton appeared to be making a very diligent
search below, for it was half an hour before he
came up to the saloon again. Most of the passengers
were out on the hurricane deck, or in other
places where they could view the scenery on the
shores of the river. I had plenty of time to get
thoroughly "primed" for the exciting interview I
anticipated. As I thought the matter over, I felt
that I had the weather-gage of him&mdash;that all the
advantage was on my side. The will was in my possession,
and subject to my order. I had the address
of my uncle's London correspondent, and whatever
Tom might threaten, he could not deprive me of
these favoring points. I could afford to be cool and
impudent; and if Tom wanted to talk, I could talk
as fast and as much to the point as he could.</p>

<p>At last I saw him come up the steps. He was
certainly a splendid-looking fellow, though he was
evidently a man of the world. He was elegantly
dressed, not over-dressed, and his movements were
easy and graceful. I could not help thinking of these
things, in which he had so decided an advantage
over me. But he lacked one thing, without which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
everything else is vain and valueless&mdash;moral principle.
He was a villain, and as such I despised him.</p>

<p>I could not help noticing that the expression on his
face was troubled, rather than malignant; indeed, he
really seemed to be more in sorrow than in anger.
He saw me when he first glanced around the saloon,
and walked towards the sofa on which I was seated.
This time he was not savage and violent, as he had
been before when I met him. He had something to
think of now, and perhaps he had learned that "that
boy" was not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Ernest," said he; and it would
have been difficult to discover in his tones that he
was an enemy.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Tom Thornton," I replied, in
cheerful tones, intending to intimate to him that I
was master of the situation.</p>

<p>"You left home rather suddenly," he continued.</p>

<p>"Rather; and I presume you did not think a
great while about it before you started."</p>

<p>"Ernest, I think we had better come to an understanding,"
he added, seating himself on the sofa at
my side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what I am about, and I suppose you
know what you are about," I answered, with easy
assurance. "I don't know that we can come to any
better understanding."</p>

<p>"I think we can," added Tom, very mildly. "I
don't believe you know what you are about."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me."</p>

<p>"Ernest, I know what you have done at your
uncle's house," said he, in a whisper, as though he
had possessed himself of a valuable secret.</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"You robbed your uncle's safe," he continued, in
the same confidential tone.</p>

<p>"That depends on whether the safe was his or
mine," I answered, readily.</p>

<p>"Ernest, it is no use for you to play bluff with
me. You know what you have done," he added,
rather petulantly; and I saw he was disappointed because
he had failed to make an impression upon me.</p>

<p>"No one knows better than I what I have done."</p>

<p>"You have taken money and valuable papers out
of your uncle's safe."</p>

<p>"I know it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"You opened it without his knowledge or consent."</p>

<p>"I know that too."</p>

<p>"And then you ran away from your home."</p>

<p>"That also I know."</p>

<p>"I was sent for by your uncle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By your father, you mean," I interposed.</p>

<p>"I said by your uncle," added he, persistently.
"I found him quite ill&mdash;made so by your bad behavior."</p>

<p>"Not much," I replied, when Tom looked into my
face to notice the effect of this revelation. "Didn't
he tell you he had not slept nights for years; that
he had steeped his soul in crime for <i>your</i> sake, Mr.
Tom Thornton?"</p>

<p>He started, sprang to his feet; but recollecting
himself, he sat down again, and tried to recover his
calmness.</p>

<p>"It's no use for you to tell me, Mr. Tom Thornton,
that your father was made ill by my bad behavior.
It was your bad behavior and his own that
trouble him."</p>

<p>"Young man, you talk just as though you were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
entirely innocent yourself," added Tom, virtuously.
"Do you really think you are free from guilt?"</p>

<p>"I think I have done nothing more than my duty."</p>

<p>"Then you believe it is all right to break into
your uncle's safe, and take his money and his papers?"</p>

<p>"Circumstances alter cases."</p>

<p>"They don't make black white."</p>

<p>"Sometimes a man's hypocrisy whitewashes his
whole life. Sometimes a man lives for years on
his ill-gotten gains, and all the world thinks he is
an honest man. Then circumstances make black
white."</p>

<p>"You are talking of something besides the subject
before us. Let us come back to it."</p>

<p>"No; I am talking about the subject before us."</p>

<p>"You confess that you robbed your uncle's safe."</p>

<p>"I admit that I helped myself to certain things in
it which I wanted. I am ready to admit it anywhere
you choose to place me," I replied, easily and
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Are you aware that you have committed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
crime?" said he, more pointedly than he had before
spoken.</p>

<p>"I don't think I have committed any crime, or
even any wrong. If you think so, Mr. Tom Thornton,
you are welcome to your opinion."</p>

<p>"I do think so," he answered, beginning to be a
little excited. "Do you know that I can arrest you,
and send you to prison?"</p>

<p>"I do know it; and I respectfully ask, Why don't
you do it?"</p>

<p>"Why don't I do it?" repeated he, apparently
amazed at my impudence, and disappointed because
an arrest and a prison appeared to have no terrors
to me.</p>

<p>"Yes, why don't you do it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why I don't do it. Because your
uncle is weak, and don't wish to injure you. That's
the reason."</p>

<p>"That isn't the reason. I want to tell you, Mr.
Tom Thornton, that nothing would suit me better
than to have you arrest me, and send me to prison."</p>

<p>This answer vexed him so much that he jumped
up, and walked off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST MAKES A LANDING ON THE
HUDSON.</h3>


<div class='cap'>TOM THORNTON was no fool, and it was easy enough
for him to see that I understood the
situation. It was useless for him to tell me that any
tenderness on the part of my uncle saved me from
arrest, for the son would have crushed me like a
worm beneath his feet in spite of the father. I think
he got up and left me because he could not control
his temper, and feared a scene. He cooled off in a
few moments, and came back, as I knew he would.</div>

<p>"You defy me to arrest you&mdash;do you, Ernest?"
said he, dropping into the seat at my side.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you wish to put it in that form, I defy
you to arrest me. I repeat that I should be very
glad to have you do it."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked he, nervously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would give me a chance to defend myself, and
that is just what I want, now I have the means to
do so."</p>

<p>"You have some queer conceits, young man,"
sneered he. "What have you done with that
girl?"</p>

<p>"She is safe."</p>

<p>"I asked you what you had done with her."</p>

<p>"And I didn't answer you."</p>

<p>"What have you done with her?"</p>

<p>"She is safe."</p>

<p>"Running away with her is another criminal offence."</p>

<p>"If it is, I shall fight that battle on the same
ground with the other. If you choose to take me
back to Parkville on any charge, of course you can
do so. If you do, a certain document will be brought
to light, which will convince Mrs. Loraine and everybody
else, that Mr. Tom Thornton, with his gold
watch and chain, his span of bays, and his fine clothes,
isn't worth a dollar in the world."</p>

<p>Tom's lip actually quivered.</p>

<p>"I don't want to injure you, Ernest," said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
"Your uncle is not willing that you should be brought
to justice."</p>

<p>"I have no desire to bring him to justice, either."</p>

<p>"You talk like a fool, like a small boy," said he,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Then don't talk with me."</p>

<p>"You will make out that you haven't done anything
wrong yourself, but your friends have made a
martyr of you. When I offer to get you out of the
scrape into which you have plunged, you speak just
as though you were the injured party."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, and I speak just what I mean. You
talk to me just as though you and your father had
not suppressed my father's will, intending to rob me
of my inheritance, and kept my mother in a madhouse
for ten or a dozen years."</p>

<p>"What sort of bosh are you talking now?" demanded
Tom, with an effort, while his face was pale,
and his frame trembled.</p>

<p>"I can prove it all. If you and your father wish
to tell me where my mother is, and to make terms
you can tell me what you will do," I added, following
up my advantage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have taken some ridiculous notion into your
head, and I really don't know what you are talking
about."</p>

<p>"Did you ever read my father's will?"</p>

<p>"Your father's will!" exclaimed he. "I never
heard that he made a will. If he did, it was the
most ridiculous thing he ever did in the whole course
of his life, for he hadn't a penny to leave."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can tell me why my uncle so persistently
refused to tell me anything about my father
or my mother?"</p>

<p>"I certainly can if you insist upon it; though,
having more regard for you than you have for
yourself, I should prefer to follow your uncle's example,
and not say anything about them."</p>

<p>"I will not ask you to spare my feelings, Mr. Tom
Thornton. Your father went so far, when I insisted
upon it, as to tell me that my mother was insane."</p>

<p>"She is, poor woman, and I don't wonder that her
reason was dethroned," replied Tom, whose face
brightened up wonderfully as he spoke.</p>

<p>"He refused to tell me anything about my father."</p>

<p>"Which was very kind of him. Your uncle is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
strange man; but his greatest weakness is his regard
for you. It is best you should know nothing of your
father; but if you wish to know, I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"I do wish to know."</p>

<p>"He committed a forgery in London, and died in
Newgate before his trial took place. Your poor
mother was so grieved that it made her insane.
Now you know the whole truth, and you can understand
why your uncle did not wish to talk to you
about your father."</p>

<p>I confess that I was rather startled by this explanation,
and I could not help asking myself if there
was any truth in it. It certainly accounted for my
uncle's unwillingness to tell me anything about my
parents. But I would not believe it. It was treachery
to my father's memory to do so.</p>

<p>"Did he make his will in Newgate?" I asked.</p>

<p>"His will! What will? I have told you he had
not a penny in the world. Your uncle has ever
since paid your mother's board in the insane
asylum."</p>

<p>"That is very kind of him. Can you tell me where
she is?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I suppose not; and probably it would not be
convenient for you to tell if you did."</p>

<p>"I would tell you if I knew. If you desire it, I
will persuade your uncle to tell you. You keep
talking about a will. What do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"I found such a document in my uncle's strong
box."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"It is safe."</p>

<p>"If there is any such document it is a mere fiction.
I don't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"You don't?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Of course when you speak of a will, you mean
something by it," persisted Tom.</p>

<p>"It's no use to talk."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the truth isn't in you."</p>

<p>"I speak the exact truth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;you don't."</p>

<p>"But I do."</p>

<p>"You know all about the will. I heard my uncle
speak to you about it; and I heard you ask if it was
not destroyed. You asked for it, and wanted to burn
it then. Don't you know anything about it now?"</p>

<p>"You heard all this?" said he, biting his lips.</p>

<p>"I heard it."</p>

<p>"You dreamed it."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't dream it. I heard a great deal more
than this. You wanted to destroy the will; but your
father said he dared not do it."</p>

<p>"Pray, where were you, when you heard all this?"</p>

<p>"On the top of the bay window of the library.
The upper sash was pulled down, so as to let the
air in."</p>

<p>"Then you are an eaves-dropper as well as a
thief."</p>

<p>"I was on the eaves of the bay window, and I
dropped down about the time you went up stairs to
look for me. Now you know all about it&mdash;and so
do I. You may tell me my father died in Newgate,
and that you never heard of any will. I shall believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
just as much of it as I please, and no more.
You think I'm a boy, Mr. Tom Thornton; but I've
got brains enough to know chalk from cheese."</p>

<p>Tom wiped his forehead. He did not like my
style; but he could not do anything. He dared
not take any decided step. After observing the
feebleness of his position, I made up my mind
that I had won the victory. He was afraid to
arrest me, and I felt as safe as though I had been
in London then. But there was one more point I
wanted to impress upon him.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, Ernest, that you have some paper
which you think is valuable; something which has
the form of a will," said Tom, after he had fidgeted
about in his seat for some time.</p>

<p>"It has that form," I replied.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what the paper is. Where
is it?"</p>

<p>"No matter where it is. I know its value, and I
have put it where, the moment you take your first
step against me, you will find it lying like a big
snake in your path."</p>

<p>"Won't you let me see it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I only want to know what it is. You need not
let it go out of your own hands."</p>

<p>"I won't show it."</p>

<p>I had made my point. I had assured him the will
would be forthcoming when he took any step to annoy
me. Tom tried all sorts of persuasion to induce
me to exhibit it; but without denying that I had it,
I declined to produce it. He was so weak that I began
to despise him. At last he got mad, and threatened
me with all sorts of calamities. I told him,
when he became abusive, that I would not talk any
more with him, and abruptly left him.</p>

<p>Most of all, I desired to shake him off and get rid
of him. While he was watching me, I could not
convey Kate to her uncle, and I was puzzled to know
what I should do. When the steamer arrived at
New York, Tom would keep both eyes fixed upon
me, and I should have no chance to assist my fair
companion. I walked about the boat, and thought
the matter over; but the more I considered it, the
more unsatisfactory it seemed.</p>

<p>About one o'clock the steamer made a landing at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Poughkeepsie. I went down to the main deck, from
which the gangway planks led to the wharf. I found
Tom Thornton there, apparently for the purpose of
assuring himself that I did not take "French leave"
of him, which was just the thing I intended to do,
if it could be done without his notice. I went forward,
but found that the stern of the boat was swung
in, so that the forward gangway was twenty feet
from the pier.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ESCAPE DEFEATED.&mdash;Page 187.</span>
</div>

<p>Returning to the saloon deck, I carefully examined
the position of the boat in regard to the shore. I
went out upon the space over the guards, and outside
of the state-rooms. On the edge of the wharf
there was a storehouse, the end of which reached
about to the middle of the steamer's wheel. The top
of the paddle-box was nearly on a level with the
flat roof of this building. I could not see Tom
Thornton, but I concluded that he was still watching
for me on the main deck. The space between
the top of the paddle-box and the roof of the storehouse
was not more than three or four feet, and I
concluded that a girl as resolute as Kate Loraine
would leap across the gulf without difficulty. I went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to her state-room, and gave the four raps. She was
glad enough to see me, and taking her valise I told
her to follow me. I waited till I heard the order
given to haul in the plank, and then led Kate up
the rude steps on the curve of the paddle-box, heedless
of the sign which interdicted passengers from
ascending.</p>

<p>A waiter shouted to me; but, fearful that I should
be accused of trying to evade the payment of our
fares, I threw him my tickets, and told him I must
land at Poughkeepsie. I reached the top of the paddle-box
with Kate, and jumped over on the roof myself,
with her carpet-bag in my hand.</p>

<p>"Now jump, Kate!" I called, as I heard the bell
ring to start the wheels.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she replied, shuddering, as she
looked down into the yawning gulf below.</p>

<p>"Jump quick, and I will catch you!"</p>

<p>"I cannot! I cannot!" exclaimed she, in an agony
of terror.</p>

<p>The wheels turned, and in an instant the space
was too wide for her to come on the roof, or for me
to return to the boat. The people discovered us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and began to shout. I saw the waiter give the tickets
to a man; but, at the same instant, Tom Thornton,
perceiving me on the roof of the storehouse,
sprang upon the rail, and leaped ashore, as the stern
swung in and grazed the pier. The steamer went on
her course; and I saw the man to whom the waiter
had given the tickets assist the frightened Kate
down from the paddle-box.</p>

<p>I was on shore, but so was Tom Thornton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST OUTFLANKS TOM THORNTON.</h3>


<div class='cap'>MY first impulse, standing on the roof of the
store, as the steamer bore Kate Loraine away
from me, was to denounce the timidity of girls in
general, and of the young lady in my charge in
particular. I am sorry to say that, as a rule, I did
not think much of girls, though I had a very high
opinion of and regard for Kate; but I am happy to
say that a few years cured the general dislike, and
increased the particular preference.</div>

<p>I was about to mutter something smart and saucy
about Kate; but a better and more charitable thought
checked the speech, and I felt that I had asked too
much of her when I required her to jump four feet,
over a chasm of such depth as that which gaped
between the steamer and the building. I suppose I
forgot, in my enthusiasm for her safety, that girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
are not used to climbing trees, and promenading on
the roofs of barns. With my second thought I
excused her, and blamed myself for expecting her
to take such a leap.</p>

<p>There I was on the roof of a storehouse in Poughkeepsie,
while the steamer was hurrying down the
river at the rate of fourteen miles an hour. If I
had separated myself from my fair charge, I had
also separated Tom Thornton from her. The enemy
was on my track, not hers, thus confirming what I
had told Kate&mdash;that he was after me rather than
her. Though I was not afraid of him, I wanted to
keep out of his way, and give him the slip if I
could.</p>

<p>There was a scuttle in the roof, upon which I
stood. I raised it a little, to obtain a view of the
interior; but at that moment I heard the voice of
Tom inquiring the way to the roof. While I had
been staring at the retreating steamer, he had entered
the building in search of me. I closed the
scuttle, and retired from its vicinity to the end of
the storehouse. Adjoining it there was a one-story
building. Throwing the carpet-bag down, I "hung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
off," and, repeating the operation, reached the ground
before Tom had made his way to the roof. Fortunately
my path led me down in the rear of the
building, and out of the way of the people, who had
been observing me from the ground. Behind this
building I conducted my retreat in as good order as
possible, but with all practicable speed.</p>

<p>The road which led down to the steamboat pier
was flanked on one side by a row of one-story buildings,
used as stores. I had jumped on one of these
shops, and thence to a narrow space on the verge
of the wharf. Before any one could go round the
storehouse, I had reached the street. I did not
dare to run, lest some one should suspect me of
being a fugitive. The street was crowded with
people, who had just landed from the steamer, and
I walked as fast as I could till I heard the screaming
whistle of a locomotive. In a few moments
more I discovered the railroad station, and being
now some distance from the steamboat wharf, I ventured
to run. I reached the station just as the train
was starting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where does this train go?" I asked of a brakeman
on a car.</p>

<p>"Down river. Be in a hurry if you are going,"
replied the man.</p>

<p>I was going, and I was in a hurry. I entered
the car and dropped into a seat, exhausted by the
hard run I had had. I caught my breath, and wiped
the perspiration from my brow, feeling that good
fortune had favored me in the most singular manner.
I had certainly given Tom Thornton the slip, and
in spite of my habitual modesty, I voted unanimously
that I was smart. But it was all luck, in this
instance, which favored me; for I heard some one
say that the train was thirty minutes late that day.
It was due in Poughkeepsie at ten minutes before
one, and left half an hour behind its time. If it
had been in season, of course I should have lost it.
I was very thankful for the accident which, the conductor
said, had delayed the train.</p>

<p>From the car window I had frequent views of the
river; and in a short time I saw the steamer in
which I had come down, ploughing her way down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the stream to her destination. I could almost fancy
I saw Kate on the hurricane deck. The poor girl
had trouble enough now, and I had no doubt she
was bitterly lamenting the misfortune which had separated
us. On whirled the train, and I soon lost
sight of the boat; but I hoped to be able to get on
board of her at her next stopping-place, if I could
find where that was. I inquired of a gentleman who
sat in front of me at what places the steamers
stopped. He informed me that some of them stopped
at all the towns, but the larger of them at only the
principal ones. I mentioned the steamer on which
I had been a passenger, and he assured me she
would make a landing at Peekskill.</p>

<p>In about an hour the train arrived at this place,
and I hastened to the river; but I was obliged to
wait over an hour before the steamer appeared. She
came up to the pier, and I went on board. I was
immediately recognized by a dozen persons who had
seen me on the roof of the storehouse. They
wanted to ask me some questions; but I avoided
them, and rushed up to the saloon. I inquired of
the stewardess for Kate, and was told that she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in her state-room. I gave the four raps, and she
opened the door.</p>

<p>"Why, Ernest Thornton!" exclaimed she. "Where
did you come from?"</p>

<p>"From up the river," I replied.</p>

<p>The inquisitive passengers had followed me to the
state-room, and I was obliged to go in and shut the
door in order to avoid them. I saw by the looks
of Kate's eyes that she had been crying. Our sudden
and unexpected separation had been even a
greater trial to her than I had supposed, and her
smile was now so full of joy that I never felt happier
before in my life.</p>

<p>"I was sure I had lost you, Ernest Thornton.
Why, how can it be that you are here, when you
were left on the wharf more than two hours ago?"
said she, bewildered by my presence, for our reunion
was quite as unexpected as the separation had been.</p>

<p>"It is very easily explained, Kate," I replied,
with abundant good-nature. "I hope you have not
been crying."</p>

<p>"But I have. I never felt so bad before in my
life. I believed I had lost the last friend I had in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the world, for I was afraid that horrible Tom Thornton
would kill you, or do something almost as bad.
But you don't explain how you happen to be here.
Did you fly?"</p>

<p>"No; I came in the train, which happened to be
half an hour late for my especial accommodation;"
and I related my story in full.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I didn't jump when you told me to
do so," said she, when I had finished. "I ought to
have jumped, even if I had been sure of falling into
the river."</p>

<p>"I ought not to have asked you to take such a
leap, Kate; and it is very fortunate that you had not
the courage to do it, for Tom Thornton would have
been with us. It couldn't have happened any better
even if we had planned it ourselves. Who was the
man that helped you down from the paddle-box?
What did the people say to you? Did you tell
them anything?"</p>

<p>"I did tell them, Ernest Thornton. I hope I
haven't done anything wrong," she replied, a sudden
shade of anxiety passing over her features.</p>

<p>"It will do no harm."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"The man that helped me down was the steward,
they said. Indeed, he was very kind to me, and so
were all the people. Half a dozen of them promised
to take care of me when I reached New York, and
help me find my uncle. They wanted to know who
you were, and why the gentleman wanted to catch
you."</p>

<p>"What did you tell them?" I asked, rather fearful
that she had told more than I cared to have the
public know about my affairs.</p>

<p>"I told them the truth; that I had been ill-used
by a person, and that you were taking me to my
uncle in New York."</p>

<p>"Did you tell them who Tom Thornton was?"</p>

<p>"I only said he had been sent after me. The
steward thought he must have supposed I was on
the building when he jumped ashore. I didn't tell
them anything about your troubles. I didn't know
that you would wish me to do so."</p>

<p>"I am glad you did not. But, Kate, you needn't
stay in here any longer. We have got rid of Tom
Thornton, and you may go out and look at the
scenery, if you wish. Have you been to dinner?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, the steward gave me some dinner. He was
very good to me, and I want to thank him ever so
much for his kindness."</p>

<p>When we left the state-room, we were surrounded
by the curious passengers, and I was obliged to tell
them the adventures I had gone through with. I
left Kate with a lady and gentleman who manifested
an interest in her, and went down to my dinner, and
when I paid for it I paid for Kate's also. When I
went on deck, I found that I was a lion, and the
passengers insisted upon hearing me roar. They
asked questions with Yankee pertinacity, and I finally
told a select party of them that I had taken
Kate out of her step-mother's house by the way of
the attic window, but I was careful not to call any
names, for if Mrs. Loraine behaved herself, I did not
care to expose her to the public.</p>

<p>"You are a smart young man," said an elderly
gentleman, heartily. "Does your father live in this
State?"</p>

<p>"I have no father, sir," I replied; and I had
dodged a dozen similar questions before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"No father. I suppose you live with your mother,"
he added, with the evident intention of drawing
me out.</p>

<p>"No, sir. My mother is in England, where I hope
soon to join her."</p>

<p>"Ah, in England!" he added, with increasing interest.
"In what part does she reside?"</p>

<p>"I do not yet know."</p>

<p>Perhaps he thought it was very odd I should not
know.</p>

<p>"I am going to England by the steamer next
Wednesday," continued the gentleman. "If I can
serve you there, it would give me great pleasure to
do so."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir;" and I began to feel a deep interest
in the subject myself.</p>

<p>"You don't know in what part of England your
mother resides, then?"</p>

<p>"I do not, but it is somewhere near London."</p>

<p>It was my turn to ask questions now; and I
was glad to do so, in order to save myself from
being "pumped." I made a great many inquiries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
about the steamer, the expense, bills of exchange,
and other matters, and the gentleman gave me much
valuable information. He left the boat at Yonkers,
but told me he should be in New York on Monday.
He gave me his address when in the city, and I
promised to call upon him if I could.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST CALLS ON SEVERAL LORAINES.</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was after four o'clock on Saturday afternoon
when the steamer arrived at her wharf in New
York. The lady and gentleman who had taken so
much interest in Kate were anxious to do something
to assist her. They were not what is called "stylish"
people, and they did not put on any airs. The
gentleman was a well-to-do farmer in the western
part of the state, and his wife doubtless superintended
the making of the butter when she was at home.
They were fifty years old, with only one child, a
grown-up son; and the lady, the moment she heard
that Kate had been ill-treated, proposed to take her
home and "do" for her.</div>

<p>In the course of the afternoon Kate mentioned
this offer to me, and declared that she liked the lady
and gentleman very much indeed. She did not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
know whether her uncle would receive her into his
family. If he was unwilling to come between her
and her step-mother, Kate was determined to go
home with the farmer, whose name was Macombe.
The worthy couple really hoped that her uncle
would not take her. I found they were going to
remain in New York for a week. They intended to
stay at a small hotel in the lower part of the city,
and I promptly adopted their suggestion to go with
them.</p>

<p>Annoying to me, and disagreeable to Kate, as was
the publicity to which we had both been exposed by
the events of the day, I could not help acknowledging
that we had been the gainers by it. The interest
excited by my singular conduct, and the sympathy
called forth by her helpless condition after we
were separated, made many friends for us. I had
dreaded the disagreeable necessity of going to a
hotel or a boarding-house with Kate, to be stared at,
questioned, and suspected, because we were so young;
but now the difficulty was entirely removed. We
could go to a public house in the train of Mr. Macombe
and his lady, and would appear to be a part
of his family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this manifest advantage, I had learned all
about the steamers that went to England, and had
actually made the acquaintance of a gentleman who
was going to London, and who was quite willing to
be my friend. If Tom Thornton would keep out of
my path till the following Wednesday, I should embark
in the steamer, and be on my way across the
ocean to find my mother.</p>

<p>Half a dozen people offered to assist Kate, when
the boat hauled in at her wharf, and the steward
was all kindness and attention. We took a carriage,
and drove to the hotel, whose name I have
forgotten; but the window of my chamber looked
out upon the Battery. As soon as we were comfortably
installed in our several apartments, I went to
the office and found a Directory. It contained the
names of four men whose surname was Loraine. I
looked a few years later and there was not a single
one. Two of them were merchants, one was a
broker, and one was a mason. Nothing was to be
learned from their occupation, and as it was too late
to find the owners of the names and their places of
business that day, I was obliged to defer the search
till Monday.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>I had left my uncle's without any clothing except
that which I wore; and if I was not in absolute need
yet of an additional wardrobe, I knew enough of the
world to believe that a quantity of baggage adds to
a person's respectability, especially at the hotels. I
walked up Broadway, and purchased a good-sized
valise, a strong and serviceable article, which would
contain all I should need in my travels. At a clothing
store I bought a good every-day suit, for that I wore
was a very nice one&mdash;too good for comfort in travelling.
At a furnishing store I procured a supply of
shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs. When I had packed
all these articles in my valise, I felt quite respectable.</p>

<p>As I was walking back to the hotel, I saw in the
window of a shop an article which was labelled
"money-belt." It was a kind of pocket-book, made
of wash-leather, attached to a belt to be worn round
the body. I went in and bought one; and it seemed
to solve the problem about the care of the large sum
of money in my possession, which had been a great
trouble to me. I could carry my funds in this belt
without the danger of being robbed; and as soon as
I reached my room, I enclosed in a piece of oiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
silk the greater part of the bills which I had carried
in my breast pocket, rolled up in a piece of newspaper,
put them in the money-belt, and strapped it
around me. It did not feel comfortable at first; but
the very annoyance it caused served to remind me
that my money was safe.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Macombe were very good, pious
people, and, wherever they were, would as soon have
thought of going without their food, as of staying
away from divine service; and we went to church
with them three times on Sunday. They would not
even talk about worldly affairs on that day; and
Kate and I were probably saved from answering a
great many questions included under the head of
forbidden topics. They seemed to be greatly pleased
to know that I regularly attended the Sunday school
at home. So pure, and true, and good were they,
and so much interested in me, that I wanted to tell
them all about my own affairs, and to ask them
whether I had done wrong in taking the will and
the money from my uncle's safe; but I concluded
that for the present it would be safer for me to
keep my own counsels. They were excellent people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
but their very simplicity of character might lead
them to betray and injure me.</p>

<p>On Monday forenoon, leaving Kate with Mrs. Macombe,
while her husband was attending to his business
affairs, I went in search of the four persons by
the name of Loraine. I had written down the address
of each, and obtained from Kate all the information
she possessed in regard to her father. I decided
to try one of the merchants first; and as Mrs.
Loraine doubtless knew the name of her deceased
husband's brother, I half expected to meet Tom
Thornton blockading the door of the uncle's counting-room.</p>

<p>When I saw, on the opposite side of the street,
the sign "Mortimer Loraine &amp; Co.," I made sure
that Tom Thornton was not in sight, and then went
in. I was directed to the private office of the senior
partner. He was a cold, stiff, formal man, and eyed
me from head to foot with a kind of contempt which
I did not appreciate.</p>

<p>"Your business with me, young man?" demanded
he, in cast-iron tones.</p>

<p>According to Parkville etiquette, he ought to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
asked me to sit down, and I was waiting for him
to do so.</p>

<p>"I called to ask, sir, if you ever had a brother by
the name of Austin Loraine," I replied.</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered he, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for troubling you, then, sir," I added,
bowing and retreating.</p>

<p>"Who was Austin Loraine?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence, sir, if he was not your
brother," I replied, still retreating.</p>

<p>"What is your business with him?" he added.</p>

<p>What my business was did not concern him, and
I opened the door and retired. Mr. Mortimer
Loraine rose from his stuffed chair and followed me,
repeating the question he had put to me. I simply
told him I wished to find the brother of Austin
Loraine; and in my heart I was very grateful that he
was not the person, for I should have been afraid to
leave Kate in the keeping of such a cast-iron man
as he was. He appeared to think he had a monopoly
of the name of Loraine, and no one else ought to
possess it, or to have relations with it which he was
not permitted to know. Giving no further heed to
him, I left his store.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>My next attempt was with the broker, William,
whose office was in Wall Street. He was quite civil,
and assured me he had but one brother, whose name
was Mortimer, and whom I had just seen on Broadway.
He was just as curious to know my business
with any one of his name as the first had been; but
I was not willing to give him any satisfaction. The
next Loraine on my list was the other merchant,
whose place of business was in Chambers Street.
"McKim &amp; Loraine" was the firm. Impressed with
the belief that the junior member of this firm would
prove to be the person I sought, I was very careful
to satisfy myself that Tom Thornton was not lying
in wait for me. In the morning I had put on the
new suit of clothes purchased on Saturday night. I
hoped this change in my dress would enable me to
pass unnoticed if he were watching for me.</p>

<p>As I did not see him anywhere in the vicinity,&mdash;though
I knew it was possible for him to be concealed
in some doorway, or observing me from some
chamber window,&mdash;I entered the store of McKim &amp;
Loraine. As I went in, I saw on a corner sign the
full names of the partners, the last of which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
"Freeman Loraine." I was directed to the counting-room
by a porter.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Loraine in?" I asked of a clerk at the
desk.</p>

<p>"He is not&mdash;gone to Baltimore," replied the man,
hardly looking up from his ledger.</p>

<p>"When will he return?" I inquired, greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>"Don't know; Mr. McKim is in his office; he can
tell you."</p>

<p>I entered a small apartment in the corner, and
asked for the senior partner. An elderly gentleman,
busy with heaps of letters, informed me that he was
the person.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Loraine very much," I continued.</p>

<p>"He has been in Baltimore for a week; we expect
he will return to-day or to-morrow&mdash;probably
to-night," answered Mr. McKim, fixing his eyes upon
the open letter before him.</p>

<p>"Have you been acquainted with Mr. Loraine
long?" I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"Thirty years," replied he, glancing at me with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
smile, as though the acquaintance was a pleasant
thing to contemplate. "He has been my partner
for twenty."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, sir, whether he ever had a
brother by the name of Austin Loraine," I added,
emboldened by his smile.</p>

<p>"He had; I knew Austin very well. He died
some eight or ten years ago," said Mr. McKim, now
so much interested in my questions that he threw
down the letter, and gave his attention wholly to
me.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to learn this, and I am sorry Mr.
Loraine is not at home."</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir; thank you; I think not. Mr. Loraine's
niece is in the city, and wishes to see him very
much," I added.</p>

<p>"Why don't she go to his house? His family
are at home."</p>

<p>"Kate is with some friends, and I think she would
rather wait till her uncle returns, as he is coming so
soon. I will call again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Mr. Loraine lives in Madison Place;" and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
gave me the number, which I wrote down on a
paper, and told Mr. McKim where Kate was staying.</p>

<p>When I went out of the store I looked again for
Tom Thornton. He must have come to the city by
this time, and I was rather surprised to find he was
not already on my track. I did not see him, but I
afterwards found out, to my sorrow, that his eye
was upon me from the moment I went into the
store of McKim &amp; Loraine. I hastened back to the
hotel, and informed Kate that I had found her uncle,
but he was not at home. She was so well cared
for by Mrs. Macombe that she was in no haste to
leave her.</p>

<p>After dinner we all took a walk on the Battery
and up Broadway, to see the sights. When we
returned, at five o'clock, we found a carriage waiting
to convey Kate and me to Mr. Loraine's house in
Madison Place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST STARTS FOR MADISON PLACE
WITH KATE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>I COULD not exactly understand how Mr. Loraine,
being in Baltimore, or on the way to New
York, had sent a carriage for his niece. It was possible
that Kate's uncle had returned sooner than he
had been expected, or that Mr. McKim had seen his
partner's family, and they had sent for Kate. It did
not occur to me that there was anything wrong;
but I desired to see Mr. Loraine, and tell him her
story before his niece went to his house.</div>

<p>"Who sent you for Miss Loraine?" I asked of the
hackman.</p>

<p>"How should I know who sint me?" replied the
driver, an ill-favored Irishman, and a rough specimen
even of New York hackmen, who are not reputed
to be saints. "A gintleman gave me this paper, and
told me to come here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>I took the paper, and read what was written upon
it: "Call at the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel for Miss Kate Loraine,
and drive her to No. &mdash; Madison Place. Bring the
young man who is with her also."</p>

<p>"Who gave you this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know who he was. It was a gintleman
that came over to the hack-stand by the Park."</p>

<p>"Was he an old man, or a young man?"</p>

<p>"Middling ould&mdash;not very ould, either; he wasn't
what you'd call a young man," replied the driver.</p>

<p>"Was he fifty?"</p>

<p>"He might be; and then again he might not be,"
answered the man.</p>

<p>This was very definite, and it was plain to me
that I could not find out from such a stupid fellow
whether or not it was Mr. McKim who had sent
him. I decided that Kate should not go to Madison
Place that day. It would be much better for me to
see her uncle first, for such a course would save her
from an unpleasant scene, if he decided not to receive
her. I told the hackman we should not go;
and the fellow growled about his fare, but finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
drove off, declaring that the people in Madison Place
should pay him for his trouble.</p>

<p>I was annoyed by the incident, and was afraid it
would prejudice Kate's uncle&mdash;if he had returned&mdash;against
her, or if he had not, that his wife would be
vexed. Before the hack was out of sight, I was
sorry I had not permitted Kate to go. I talked the
matter over with her, and with her kind friends, who
thought I had been over-nice about the matter.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock, the same hackman came
again. I was sent for, and met him in the office.
He was as surly and cross as before, though
his face wore something like an expression of triumph
this time.</p>

<p>"It's a dale of throuble you're makin for your
friends," said he, handing me a note.</p>

<p>"You shall be paid for all the trouble I give you,"
I replied, offended at the fellow's impudence.</p>

<p>I glanced at the note, and found it was directed
to Kate. I carried it up to her, and after she had
read it, she handed it to me.</p>

<p>"My uncle has returned," said she. "He seems to
be real good and kind&mdash;don't he?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>I read the note, which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Niece</span>: I learned from Mr. McKim,
since I returned from Baltimore this afternoon, that
you were in the city. I should call upon you myself,
but I am quite ill, and do not feel able to do
so. I desire to see you very much, and the bearer
of this note will drive you to my house. I think
Mr. McKim spoke of a young man with you, who
called upon him. Let him come with you, if you
please.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Freeman Loraine.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>"Your uncle is good and kind, and I am sorry I
gave him the trouble to send twice," I added, when
I had finished reading the note. "We will go with
the hackman as soon as you are ready."</p>

<p>"How far is it?" asked Mrs. Macombe.</p>

<p>"Mr. Loraine lives in Madison Place; but I haven't
the least idea where that is," I replied.</p>

<p>"Shall we see you again?" asked our kind friend.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I hope so. I will come down and see
you. But I don't know yet whether I am to stay
with my uncle or not," said Kate, as she put on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
shawl and bonnet. "I must see you again, and I
shall tell my uncle all about you."</p>

<p>"I shall depend upon seeing you again, and I hope
you will find a good and pleasant home," added the
worthy old lady.</p>

<p>I escorted Kate down to the street, and handed
her into the carriage. The driver closed the door
when I had taken my seat, mounted his box, and
drove off.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure, Kate, that you will remain with
your uncle," said I, as the hack rattled up Broadway.</p>

<p>"You can't be sure," replied she, somewhat excited
by the prospect that was opening before her.</p>

<p>"Not exactly sure; but the interest he manifests
in you, and the trouble he takes to have you come
to his house, convince me that he is a man worthy
to be your father's brother."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will scold me for running away from
Mrs. Loraine," suggested she, timidly.</p>

<p>"I think not. He will not be willing that you
should be shut up for a whole week for taking long
stitches, or for treading on a flower. There may be
some difficulty in the way, as your step-mother is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
legally your guardian; but your uncle will find a
way to release you from such odious bondage. But
we won't anticipate anything. If your uncle won't
take care of you, I will, for I like you, Kate, and I
mean to stand by you just as long as you need any
help. Mrs. Macombe will be very glad to take you
home with her."</p>

<p>"I seem to have plenty of friends now. But, however
many friends I may have, Ernest Thornton, I
shall always be grateful to you for what you have
done for me. I shall always consider you my first
and best friend on earth. But you are going off,
over the ocean; and I shall not see you again."</p>

<p>"I shall return soon."</p>

<p>"When shall you go?"</p>

<p>"I shall not go till I am sure you are safe and
well provided for. If, as I expect, your uncle takes
you to his home, I shall start day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I cannot needlessly waste a single day.
My poor mother, for aught I know, is still in sorrow
and suffering."</p>

<p>"How glad she will be to see you, if you find her!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall find her; I shall not give up the search
until I do find her, if it takes me all the rest of my
lifetime. But I expect to be successful without much
trouble."</p>

<p>We were silent then for half an hour, I judged, in
which I was thinking of the great mission that was
before me; and I have no doubt Kate was anticipating
the scene that awaited her at the house of
her uncle. The carriage still rattled along, and it
was beginning to be dark, for we had been riding
nearly an hour. I thought it was about time for us
to reach Madison Place. We must have gone at
least six miles, and I came deliberately to the conclusion
that New York was a bigger city than I had
ever supposed.</p>

<p>"Haven't you got almost to Madison Place?" I
shouted to the driver, when my patience began to
be sorely tried.</p>

<p>"It's a good piece yet," replied the driver, in the
same surly tones.</p>

<p>"I think we must be almost up to Albany," I said
to Kate, as I glanced out at the window.</p>

<p>"Not quite so far as that," laughed Kate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"This don't look like a very aristocratic part of
the city," I added. "The houses are all of wood,
and poor ones at that."</p>

<p>"You must be patient, Ernest Thornton. We must
soon reach my uncle's house."</p>

<p>"Your uncle's, or Albany, I should say."</p>

<p>We were silent again. It did not seem to me
possible that Madison Place could be so far off.
While I was fretting about the distance, I heard a
whistle like that with which one calls his dog,
three times repeated. I should not have noticed
it, if the carriage had not stopped in the middle
of the street immediately after I heard it. The
halt was but for an instant&mdash;long enough to permit
a man to get on the box with the driver.</p>

<p>"How much farther is it to Madison Place?" I
demanded again.</p>

<p>"Only a little piece," answered the surly driver;
but he seemed to be more pliable now.</p>

<p>I looked out at the window again. The houses
were meaner and more scattered than before, and
there were no signs of a mansion fit for the residence
of a wealthy merchant. I began to wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
who the man was on the box with the driver, and
why he had whistled. I changed my position to the
front seat, under the window, which I had opened
to enable me to speak to the driver.</p>

<p>I began to have a suspicion that something was
wrong, and I determined to investigate as far as it
was possible to do so. I waited to hear if anything
was said by the two men on the box. I listened
eagerly and painfully, for my suspicions almost made
me mad. I reviewed the circumstances under which
we had left the hotel. The letter was signed by Mr.
Loraine, and the driver told me he had brought it
from Madison Place.</p>

<p>My heart rose up into my throat, as the conviction
flashed upon my mind that Kate and I were the
victims of some villanous scheme. The rascally driver
could not have gone to Madison Place in the time
that intervened between his two calls at the hotel,
if Madison Place was farther off than we had yet
gone. I was so nervous and restless that Kate fathomed
my painful anxiety. She could not help believing
by this time that something was wrong.</p>

<p>"O, Ernest Thornton!" exclaimed she, when it was
no longer possible for her to keep still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Kate," I replied; but I was
fearfully alarmed myself.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but it is plain enough now that
we have been deceived."</p>

<p>"Tom Thornton has done this!" gasped she.</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but be calm, Kate. Heaven will
protect us."</p>

<p>"I am frightened almost to death," said she, with
chattering teeth. "What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. Keep as cool as you can, and
leave it all to me. They can't go a great ways
farther with this team. We must stop soon."</p>

<p>I was strongly impressed with the opinion that it
was time something was done. Of course the wretches
on the box had made their plans beforehand, and
everything seemed to be working well for them.
Doubtless they would have the means of securely
disposing of their victims when they reached their
destination. It seemed to me to be necessary, therefore,
to derange their plans, if possible, and I waited
for a favorable time to make a demonstration.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST STRIKES A HEAVY BLOW, AND TOM
THORNTON HAS A BAD FALL.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE chances for making a demonstration were
not favorable; but the more desperate the circumstances,
the greater was the need of doing something
before we were committed to any place more
secure than a carriage. If I had been alone I should
have opened the door and jumped out; but Kate
could not do this. While I was considering what
I could do, I heard the driver speak. I raised myself
up to the window, and listened for the reply of
the other man.</div>

<p>Though I could not tell what was said, I recognized
the voice of Tom Thornton. I had come to
the conclusion, as soon as my suspicions were aroused,
that it was he; for it was not likely that he would
trust the execution of his scheme wholly to others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
I confess that the sense of being injured was not the
only emotion that disturbed me. I was filled with
anger and indignation at the trick which had been
put upon me. I wanted a weapon like my trusty
base-ball bat, and I felt that, if I had it, I should
do good service with it.</p>

<p>The thought of the bat suggested an idea. In
going up to Chambers Street in the forenoon, I had
seen a hackman oiling his wheels at the stand by
the Park. When he finished, he put the iron
wrench he had used under one of the seats in the
carriage. I felt for one in this vehicle, and realized
a savage gratification when I placed my hand upon
the article. The implement was about a foot and a
half in length, but not very heavy. Having decided
upon the plan of the intended assault, I buttoned
my sack coat, and thrust the wrench into the open
space between two of the buttons.</p>

<p>Half paralyzed with terror, Kate asked me what
I was going to do. I told her in a whisper to
keep still. In a fair, stand-up fight with two men,
I should be instantly vanquished, and it was necessary
for me to obtain the advantage of a surprise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
if possible. The rear window of the carriage was
open. Though the aperture was small, it was large
enough for me to crawl through, and I worked myself
out upon the baggage-rack. The jar which I
communicated to the vehicle by this movement attracted
the attention of the men on the box.</p>

<p>"Be aisy for a minute more, and you'll be at
Madison Place," said the driver.</p>

<p>"How much farther is it?" I asked, thrusting my
head into the window, so that he would not suspect
that I had got out of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Only a short piece farther," he added.</p>

<p>Placing one foot on a ledge at the side of the
hack, and the other on the bottom of the back
window, I scrambled to the top of the carriage,
where I was obliged to spread out like a frog, and
was in imminent danger of sliding off. Of course
this feat of gymnastics could not be effected without
considerable noise. It was evident to the driver that
something decided had taken place, or was about to
take place, and he began to rein in his horses.</p>

<p>Just as I reached my perch on the top of the
hack, all sprawling, the vehicle was approaching one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of those small public houses at the corner of a cross
street, which abound in the upper part of New York
and Harlem. In front of it burned a street lamp.
Tom Thornton&mdash;and I could distinctly make him
out now, though I did not see his face&mdash;had bent
his head down to look in at the front window. He
doubtless expected to find the cause of the noise and
the jar within the hack; at least, thinking I was
there, it was natural for him to look inside for it.
I suppose he thought I was breaking out through
the top of the vehicle.</p>

<p>With the wrench in my hand, I sprang forward;
but my blood was almost frozen at the necessity of
striking him a blow on the head which might kill
him, and the thought that I might take his life partially
paralyzed my arm. I struck, but it was a
feeble stroke compared with what it should have
been to effect my purpose. His hat appeared to
break the force of the blow, and he sprang to his
feet. Then I saw that he had a heavy cane in his
hand, and I was sorry I had not struck harder.</p>

<p>"Drive on! Don't stop here!" said he to the
driver, fearful, perhaps, that I might obtain assistance
from the hotel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="500" height="396" alt="ON THE WAY TO MADISON PLACE.&mdash;Page 224." title="" />
<span class="caption">ON THE WAY TO MADISON PLACE.&mdash;Page 224.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>With his cane in one hand, he reached forward
with the other to grasp me by the collar; or this
was what I supposed he intended to do. He did
not see that I had a weapon, and getting up on my
knees, I hit him again, this time with better effect,
for he fell over backward upon the horses. The
driver hauled in his team again, and seemed to be
appalled at the fate of his companion.</p>

<p>The instant he stopped I slid off the top of the
hack to one of the hind wheels, and thence to the
ground. I opened the door of the carriage, and told
Kate to get out with all possible haste. I assisted
her to the ground, and taking her by the hand,
actually dragged her after me. The gloom of the
night covered us, and we fled as fast as my companion's
trembling limbs would permit. I turned
into a cross street, on which there were no buildings,
and followed it till we came to another avenue.</p>

<p>I expected to be pursued; whether we were or
not, I do not know, for we were not molested, and
I neither saw nor heard anything which indicated a
search. Whether the hackman, knowing that he
was engaged in doubtful business, did not call for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
assistance, or whether the pursuit was delayed till it
was too late to catch us, I have no information. We
walked down the avenue as rapidly as possible, till
I was satisfied we should not be overtaken.</p>

<p>"O, Ernest Thornton," gasped Kate, out of breath
with fatigue and terror, after we had walked a couple
of miles, "I shall sink to the ground soon!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry for you, Kate; but what can I do?"
I replied.</p>

<p>"I am tired out; and I am so frightened, I can
hardly walk."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed; we are safe now," I added,
drawing her arm through mine. "Now lean on
me."</p>

<p>"But you must be tired, Ernest Thornton."</p>

<p>"No, not a particle; let me help you as much as
I can."</p>

<p>"This is much easier than it was before," said
she; and she clung to me like a frightened child&mdash;as
indeed she was.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid to lean your whole weight upon
me," I added. "I would carry you if I could."</p>

<p>I think it was her fears more than her exertions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that exhausted her; and, by the time we had walked
another mile, as I estimated the distance, she declared
that she felt better, and more able to walk
than at first. As we continued on our way, I saw
a horse car on another avenue,&mdash;street railroads at
that time were not so abundant as now,&mdash;and we
followed a cross street till we came to the track.</p>

<p>"I feel ever so much better now!" exclaimed
Kate, as the circumstances became more hopeful.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to fear," I replied. "I
wish I knew how Tom Thornton was."</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter with him?" asked Kate,
with astonishment; and I perceived that she had no
definite idea of what had happened before the public
house. The poor girl was so terrified that she had
hardly known anything from the time our suspicions
were first excited till we had walked two or three
miles from the scene of the affray.</p>

<p>"Did you think, Kate, that he permitted us to
leave the carriage?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't think anything about it; I was so frightened
I couldn't think."</p>

<p>"I hope he is not badly hurt," I added, musing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Badly hurt! Why, what do you mean, Ernest
Thornton?" she asked, her terror renewed by my
words.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Kate; he deserved all he got,
and more too, if the blow didn't kill him."</p>

<p>"Why, Ernest Thornton!"</p>

<p>"Do you see this?" I added, holding up the
wrench, which, from an instinct of self-preservation,
I had kept in my hand.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"An iron wrench. I struck Tom Thornton over
the head with it, and he fell from the drivers box
on the backs of the horses."</p>

<p>"O!" groaned she.</p>

<p>"It could not be helped, Kate."</p>

<p>"I hope he is not much hurt."</p>

<p>"I hope not; but I can't help it if he is," I replied,
desperately, for I had many fears in regard to
the result, and was not half so confident of the future
as I tried to appear. "There is a car, Kate,"
I added, throwing the wrench away. "Now be
calm, and try to look as though nothing had happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>She covered her face with a thick veil, and we
entered the horse car. Riding in silence for a long
hour, we reached the Park, where, taking a stage,
we proceeded to the hotel. It was nearly eleven
o'clock when we went into the parlor, where Kate
sank exhausted upon a sofa. I found that Mrs.
Macombe had retired, but I called her up. The
poor girl's nerves were fearfully unstrung, but the
good woman ministered to her like an angel. She
slept with her, and was all that a loving mother
could be to her.</p>

<p>For my own part, I ate a hearty supper, and went
to bed. It was not without the fear that the police
would visit me before morning, that I lay on my
couch thinking of the startling events of the evening.
Yet, as I repeated my prayer that night, I felt that
I had done no more than my duty&mdash;my duty to
Kate, my mother, and myself. I would have given
half the money in my belt to know whether Tom
Thornton was dead or alive. I had not injured him
from malice or for revenge, only in self-defence; and
I felt that a just God would burden him, rather than
me, with the consequences of the blow I had struck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
I went to sleep at last, with the prayer in my heart,
that Tom Thornton would recover from the injury
he had received.</p>

<p>Kate was quite ill in the morning; but Mrs. Macombe
cared for her tenderly, and assured me nothing
serious would result from the terror and excitement
to which she had been subjected. After breakfast
I hastened to the store of McKim &amp; Loraine.
Kate's uncle had returned the preceding evening,
and I waited till he came down town. In as few
words as possible, I told him what Kate's situation
had been at the house of her step-mother,
what abuse she had suffered, and in what manner
she had escaped. He was indignant, and insisted
that she should immediately make his house her
home.</p>

<p>Then I showed him the note signed with his
name, which the hackman had brought for Kate. It
was a forgery, and Mr. Loraine could hardly control
his anger. I related to him our adventure at Harlem,
and described the scene on the top of the
hack.</p>

<p>"Served him right!" exclaimed he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may have killed him," I added.</p>

<p>"I hope you did," replied he, bluntly. "I will go
and see Kate at once."</p>

<p>On our arrival at the hotel, we found the hackman
there who had driven us out to Harlem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST VISITS MADISON PLACE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>I'M waiting for you," said the hack-driver, as I
entered the office of the hotel with Mr. Loraine.</div>

<p>"What do you want of me?" I demanded, supposing
the villain was charged with the execution of
some further design upon me.</p>

<p>"I want my money," he growled.</p>

<p>"What money?"</p>

<p>"For driving you out to Harlem."</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to pay that?"</p>

<p>"As the gintleman didn't pay me, I expect you to
do so," he replied, with refreshing coolness.</p>

<p>"Where is the gentleman now?" I asked; and,
wishing to obtain some information in regard to
Tom, if I could, I did not decline to pay his demand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know where he is."</p>

<p>"What became of him?"</p>

<p>"With the help of some people I found in the
bar-room, I took him into the public house. Bedad,
it was a hard crack you guv him," added the hackman,
in a low tone. "If you pay me the tin dollars,
I won't say anything agin you."</p>

<p>"You carried him into the public house," I repeated.
"What then?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I tell you. Begorra, I thought he was
kilt, sure," he replied, in confidential whispers. "A
bad scrape it was, and I didn't want to be in it; so
I jumped on my box and druv off telling 'em I was
goin' for a docther."</p>

<p>"Don't you know what became of him?"</p>

<p>"Faix, I do. Two hours afther, I sent a frind of
mine, one Michael Mallahy, that lives convanient to
the public house, to go and drink a glass of beer at
the bar-room, and inquire for the man that was
hurted. Now pay me my tin dollars, and I won't
say a word."</p>

<p>"Did your friend find out about the man that
was hurt?" I inquired, putting my hand into my
pocket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Faix, he did. The gintleman wasn't kilt at all.
He came out of it with only a sore head, and left
the public house all alone by himself."</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard of him since?"</p>

<p>"Not one word; and I don't know where in the
world is he."</p>

<p>"And he didn't pay you?" I added, withdrawing
my hand empty from my pocket.</p>

<p>"He did not thin."</p>

<p>"He served you just right, then," I continued.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to pay me my tin dollars?"
said he, looking uglier than usual.</p>

<p>"I am not&mdash;not I."</p>

<p>"Begorra, thin, I will inform the police," replied
he, savagely. "You struck the gintleman on the
head with the wrinch, and I'll have you in the
Tombs."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble!" asked Mr. Loraine, who
had been impatiently waiting for me in another part
of the room, as he stepped up to the hackman, his
attention attracted by the fellow's anger.</p>

<p>"That is the man that drove us out to Harlem
last night," I answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your number?" demanded Mr. Loraine of
the surly brute.</p>

<p>The hackman looked at him. The New York
merchant was no tyro, and Jehu, preferring not to
deal with one who understood the characteristics of
his class, suddenly bolted through the open door, and
ran for his hack. Mr. Loraine pursued him; but the
rascal had left his carriage on the Bowling Green
side of the street, and he distanced both of us.
Leaping upon his box, he drove off as fast as his
horses could go.</p>

<p>"Didn't you notice the number of his hack?"
asked Mr. Loraine, as we returned to the hotel.</p>

<p>"I did not, sir."</p>

<p>"What did he want of you?"</p>

<p>"He wished me to pay him ten dollars for driving
Kate and me out to Harlem last night," I replied,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It did not take you long to give him an answer
to such a demand."</p>

<p>"I wanted to know why Tom Thornton had not
paid him. It seems that the scoundrel, when he
found his employer was hurt, was afraid of getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
into trouble, and left him. I put my hand into my
pocket, as though I intended to pay him, so as to
induce him to tell me what I wanted to know."</p>

<p>"You'll do!" added Mr. Loraine, smiling. "But
what did become of Thornton?"</p>

<p>"When the hackman sent a friend of his to inquire
about him, Tom Thornton had come to his senses
and left."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll hear from him again. If you do,
let me know. Now, where is Kate?"</p>

<p>I conducted him up stairs to Mrs. Macombe's parlor.
Mr. Loraine proved to be all I had wished him
to be&mdash;sympathizing, noble, and decided. He asked
Kate a great many questions, in order to assure himself
that she was not a naughty, wilful, and disobedient
girl; and, in answer to them, she told her whole
story, as she had told it to Bob Hale and me in the
standing-room of the Splash. I made a voluntary
statement of my impressions in regard to the step-mother,
and the interview I had had with her.</p>

<p>"I never liked the woman," added Mr. Loraine;
"and, till the day of my brother's death, I did not
cease to regret his marriage. Why didn't you write
to me, Kate?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"She would not let me."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell Mr. Windleton about the
treatment you received?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't so bad till after Mr. Windleton went
to Europe."</p>

<p>"We will have it made right at once. I have
done some business for Windleton during his absence;
for he was a friend of mine, as well as of my brother.
He will be shocked when he hears of this business.
I expect him back the next steamer, due to-day
or to-morrow. I shall go and see this woman
as soon as he returns."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go back to her, uncle Freeman,"
said Kate, with a suppressed shudder.</p>

<p>"You shall not; you shall live with me, if you
are so disposed."</p>

<p>"O, uncle!"</p>

<p>Kate cried; I am sure I don't know why, for
there was certainly nothing to cry about. Mrs. Macombe,
I know, was sorry that Kate was going to
live with her uncle, for she had already become very
much attached to her, and would gladly have given
her a home, and been a mother to her. When they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
parted, Mr. Loraine promised that his niece should
visit her at no distant day. I was taking my leave
of Kate, when her uncle interposed, and insisted that
I should go with them to his residence. My fair
fellow-traveller would not permit me to leave yet,
and a carriage was called, in which we started for
Madison Place.</p>

<p>The ride was not so long as the one we had
taken on the preceding evening. Kate was warmly
welcomed by Mrs. Loraine and her family; and when
I saw the kindness that beamed in their eyes, and
was reflected from their actions, I was confident
that Kate had found a good home&mdash;that best of
earthly blessings. I was sorry to part with her; indeed,
I did not know how strongly I was interested
in her until the hour of separation came. I bade
good by to the family, and she followed me to the
street door.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to go, Ernest Thornton," said
she, calling me, as she invariably did, by my full
name.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go, Kate; but you know what
work I have on my hands," I replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cannot my uncle help you? I know he would
be willing to do so," she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think I need any more help. If Tom
Thornton troubles me any more, I shall apply to
him. But I think I have given Tom his quietus
for the present. He will carry a sore head around
with him for some time. But I must go now. The
steamer sails to-morrow, you know."</p>

<p>"Shall I not see you again?" she asked, beginning
to be very much moved.</p>

<p>"I will call upon you this evening, if I can."</p>

<p>"You will come, Ernest Thornton&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"If possible, I will."</p>

<p>"And when you get to England, you must write
to me."</p>

<p>"I will certainly do that. Good by, Kate."</p>

<p>She extended her hand to me, and I took it.
Then I hastened away, fearful that she would cry
again. I walked down the street thinking of her.
She was not as pretty as many young ladies I had
met, but she was exceedingly interesting, to say nothing
of the grace of her form, which I have never
seen surpassed. She is as graceful and interesting
now as she was then. But I will not anticipate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not expect to hear any more from Tom
Thornton, and I did not fear any obstacles to my
departure for England the next day. I took from
my pocket the card which the gentleman whose acquaintance
I had made on board the Albany steamer
had given me. His name was Solomons. I afterwards
learned that he was a Jew; and my estimate
of the whole Jewish people was very much increased
after a few days' intimacy with him. His hotel was
written in pencil under his name. I readily found
it, and he was in his room.</p>

<p>He received me very kindly; but I had to tell
him everything that had occurred after my arrival in
the city, before I could introduce the topic which was
uppermost in my mind. He was warmly interested
in the affairs of Kate, and was delighted when I told
him she was then with her uncle's family as happy
as she could be.</p>

<p>"I shall sail for England with you to-morrow, sir,"
I added, when Kate's history had been disposed of.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! I'm glad to hear it. Have you
engaged your passage yet?" he asked, briskly.</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet, my boy! I am afraid you'll find no
berth. The other one in my state-room was not
taken yesterday, but I fear we are too late for it to-day.
We will go down and see to it at once."</p>

<p>We rode down to the steamer office in a stage,
and Mr. Solomons inquired rather nervously about
the other berth in his room.</p>

<p>"It was taken not more than half an hour ago,"
replied the clerk.</p>

<p>"That's unfortunate," added my friend, apparently
as much disappointed as I was. "What else have
you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing just now. A gentleman has taken Nos.
41 and 42," he added, pointing to the plan of the
cabins, on the counter before him; "but there is
some doubt whether he will go. He engaged the
room yesterday, and I promised to keep it for him
till all the other berths were taken. He was here a
while ago, and said he would give his final answer
in an hour. It is time he was here."</p>

<p>"In that case we will wait a while," continued
Mr. Solomons. "I engaged my passage a month
ago, and the ship was half full then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Couldn't I find some place on board?" I asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know; the officers sometimes give up
their rooms for a consideration. I gave the third
officer five pounds for his room the last time I came
over from Liverpool."</p>

<p>"I have concluded to take that room," said a
young man, rather dashily dressed, as he rushed hastily
up to the counter.</p>

<p>My heart sank within me, for the announcement
seemed to mean that I had lost my passage. But
I was determined to go on board of the steamer,
and make an arrangement with any officer who was
open to a treaty for the use of his state-room.</p>

<p>"You take both berths?" added the clerk.</p>

<p>"No," replied the young man, glancing at me, as
I had seen him do several times before.</p>

<p>"Then here is your chance," said the clerk to Mr.
Solomons.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF
E. DUNKSWELL.</h3>


<div class='cap'>MR. SOLOMONS examined the plan again to
ascertain the locality of the state-room which
contained the unoccupied berth.</div>

<p>"It is on the other side of the ship from mine,"
said he. "But we can do no better."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this gentleman will exchange with you,"
suggested the clerk.</p>

<p>"I am quite willing to take the young gentleman
into my state-room," answered the stranger.</p>

<p>"Of course he will take the vacant berth in that
room," added Mr. Solomons, who did not seem to
think that the offer of the stranger was very magnanimous,
since the berth in his room could be taken
by the next applicant, whether he was willing or
not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The clerk had written the receipt for the passage
money paid him by the young man, and pushed it
across the counter towards him. The name on the
paper was E. Dunkswell. I confess that I was not
particularly pleased with Mr. Dunkswell, and did not
care to occupy a state-room with him. Besides
being rather jauntily dressed, he wore too much jewelry
to suit my taste. His speech was somewhat
peculiar, and I set him down as a fast young man.
He appeared to be about twenty-one years old, though
possibly he was more than that.</p>

<p>"I have the lower berth in this room," said Mr.
Solomons, addressing the stranger, and pointing to
his room on the plan. "It is about the same kind
of a room as your own. If you would exchange
berths with me, it would oblige me very much."</p>

<p>"I should be very happy to accommodate you,"
replied the fast young man, "but for particular reasons
I desire to occupy the berth I have engaged."</p>

<p>"My room is just as good as the one you have
taken," added Mr. Solomons.</p>

<p>"Very true; but I like the locality of mine better
than yours."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>It was evident that Mr. Dunkswell had a decided
opinion of his own in this matter; and my kind
friend was too much of a gentleman to say anything
more about the exchange. He engaged the berth;
but there was still a hope that an arrangement might
be made with the person who had taken the upper
berth in Mr. Solomons' state-room. Just then it occurred
to me, as I saw the clerk writing the receipt
for me, that my money was where I could not get
at it in a public place; but it was only a short distance
to the hotel, and I ran over to my room, and
put the greater part of my funds in my wallet. The
passage money was paid, and with a lively emotion
of pleasure at the prospect which the ticket opened
to me, I put it into my pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Solomons then went with me to a banker's,
for I had taken his advice, and resolved to procure
a letter of credit on a London banker. My friend
was very much surprised, and I think he was a little
suspicious, when I told him I had over a thousand
dollars in my pocket. The banker gave me a letter
of credit for two hundred pounds, and I deposited
a thousand dollars with him, as security. On my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
return I was to settle with him for whatever sums
I had drawn, and he was to pay me back the balance,
with four per cent. interest. Mr. Solomons
was particular to have it understood by the banker
in London that the money would be drawn by a
young man sixteen years of age, and I left my signature
to be forwarded to him.</p>

<p>My business was all done, and I parted with Mr.
Solomons, to meet him again the next day on board
the steamer. In the evening, I went up to Madison
Place, and staid till nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose has been here this afternoon?"
asked Kate of me, as I was taking my
leave.</p>

<p>"Not Tom Thornton?" I replied, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No; the gentleman we saw on the steamboat&mdash;your
friend; he was with you to-day."</p>

<p>"Mr. Solomons?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he told me what a lot of money you had,
and wanted to know if you had come honestly
by it."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you tell him?" I asked, anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"I told him the money was rightfully your own.
He told me he supposed it was all right, though over
a thousand dollars was a large sum for a mere boy
to have, and manage himself."</p>

<p>I had almost concluded before to tell Mr. Solomons
the whole truth in regard to myself; and the
trouble he had taken to satisfy himself of my honesty,
decided me to do so at the first convenient
opportunity. I did not bid Kate a final good-by
when I left the house, for Mr. Loraine promised to
take her over to Jersey City, where the steamer lay,
to "see me off." On my way to the hotel, I visited
the post-office, as I had done every day since my
arrival in the city. This time I found a letter from
Bob Hale, and I hastened to my room at the hotel
to read it.</p>

<p>It was a long letter, full of warm and generous
feeling towards me&mdash;it was just like Bob. He informed
me that my uncle was apparently as well as
usual; he had gone to the cottage, and inquired of
old Betsey. There had been a great deal of talk
about my going off; but no one knew anything about
the real circumstances. Mrs. Loraine had taken pains
to "hush up" the facts in regard to Kate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"When my father came home," wrote Bob, "I
told him your story, as you wished me to do. He
shook his head, and said it was a foolish story, and
he feared you were a bad boy, after all. But when
I showed him your father's will, and he had read it,
he caved in like an avalanche. He told me he
thought, from your uncle's singular life, that something
ailed him, and your story explained it perfectly.
He was sorry you had not come to him, instead
of going away. I told him you wanted to find your
mother, and cared more for her than you did for the
money. He praised you then, and hoped you would
find her. He put the will in his safe, and you may
be sure it will be forthcoming when you want it."</p>

<p>Bob related all the news about the fellows in Parkville,
and wished me to answer his letter immediately.
I did so that night, giving him all the incidents
of my trip to New York, and the events which
occurred after my arrival, with my plans for the
future. When I went to bed I could not sleep, I
was so excited by the fact that I was going to England
the next day. I trembled when I thought of
my mother, and of what might happen to prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
my finding her. I heard the clock on Trinity Church
strike three before I went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock when I awoke, and I was to
be on board the steamer at ten. I ate my breakfast,
paid my bill, and left the hotel with my valise in
my hand. A stage up Greenwich Street carried me
nearly to the ferry, and I reached the steamer half
an hour before the appointed time. I found the
state-room which I was to share with "E. Dunkswell,"
where I left my valise, the evidence of my
respectability, and then went on deck. Mr. Loraine
and Kate soon appeared, and I spent the time with
them until those not going in the ship were required
to leave. Kate cried then; I took her hand and
kissed her&mdash;I could not help it. We parted as
brother and sister would part, and I watched her on
the wharf until she could no longer be seen. The
ponderous wheels of the great ship revolved, and we
moved slowly down the harbor.</p>

<p>I was excited by the scene and its surroundings,
by the thought that I was leaving the land
where I had lived from my childhood, and more than
all by the reflection that I was going to seek and find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
my mother. Everything was new and strange to
me. I wandered through every part of the ship open
to a passenger. I gazed at the shores, and I studied
the faces of my fellow-voyagers. Off Sandy Hook
the pilot was discharged, and the prow of the noble
steamer pointed out to the middle of the great ocean
that rolled between me and my mother. The excitement
on board began to subside; the passengers
went below to arrange their state-rooms for the
voyage.</p>

<p>When I first went on board I entered the dining
saloon, where I found a few passengers selecting their
seats at the tables. Mr. Solomons had told me in
travelling to do as others did; so I took a couple of
cards, wrote my friend's name on one and my own on
the other, and pinned them to the table-cloth, as near
the head of the captain's table as I could find two
vacant places. This secured us pleasant seats for the
voyage, and Mr. Solomons was pleased with my
thoughtfulness, as he called it. Before we reached
Sandy Hook, he proposed to his room-mate to exchange
berths with me; but when Mr. Dunkswell was
pointed out to him as the person whose state-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he was to share, he politely but regretfully declined
to do so, leaving his reasons to be inferred, for he
did not give them.</p>

<p>When the gong sounded for lunch, at twelve
o'clock, I found to my surprise that Mr. Dunkswell
had taken the seat next to mine. I was rather prejudiced
against him; partly because he refused to exchange
berths with my friend, and partly because
Mr. Solomons' room-mate did not like him well
enough to exchange with me. He was very polite
to me, and seemed to be strongly inclined to cultivate
an intimacy with me. I could not do less
than be civil to him. He invited me to drink wine
with him at lunch, and to smoke his cigars afterwards,
neither of which I could do.</p>

<p>At four we dined, and Mr. Dunkswell renewed his
efforts to be intimate with me; and the more he persevered,
the more he didn't accomplish anything. I
did not like him, and I could not like him. At dinner
he drank more wine than his head could bear,
and this did not make him any more agreeable to
me. After dinner, Mr. Solomons and myself took
seats upon the hurricane deck. He mentioned that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
he had called to see Kate the preceding evening,
and this afforded me an opportunity to tell my story,
to which my friend listened with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>He assured me that I had done right; that it was
my duty to find my mother; that the fact of my
uncle's misapplying my father's fortune justified me
in taking the money and the papers from the safe.
He commended me for my spirit, and for my devotion
to my mother. If I had not felt sure of his
approbation beforehand, I suppose I should not have
had the courage to tell him my history. At half past
seven we went down to tea; and this time Mr.
Dunkswell did not make his appearance.</p>

<p>After a promenade on deck till nine o'clock, I
found myself tired enough to retire, and more inclined
to sleep than I had been before since I left
Parkville. I went to my state-room, and found the
door locked on the inside. I knocked, but Mr. Dunkswell,
politely but in rather muddled tones, requested
me to wait a moment. I did wait a moment, and
was admitted. My room-mate was tipsy, but not
enough so to make him anything more than silly.
He was lying in his berth, with his clothes off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Having occasion to open my valise, I found the
contents in a very confused state, and not as I had
left them. I was somewhat startled, and hastened
to examine further. I had put my letter of credit,
and about two hundred dollars in bank bills, in my
money belt. The letters I had taken from my uncle's
safe I had deposited in my valise. They could be
of no value to any one on board but myself, and I
thought they would be safe in the state-room.</p>

<p>They were not safe; to my astonishment and dismay,
they were not to be found. I had placed them
under my best suit, and they were certainly gone.
The confusion in my valise indicated that they had
been stolen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST FINDS THAT E. DUNKSWELL IS A
DISAGREEABLE ROOM-MATE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;WAS vexed, and almost disheartened, by the
loss of the letter addressed to Bunyard. My plan
to find my mother rested mainly on the possession
of it. I had placed the letters in the valise after I
came on board, and they must have been taken out
after the steamer discharged her pilot. There was
not much room for a mystery, for I immediately
jumped to the conclusion that E. Dunkswell was the
person who had robbed me.</div>

<p>E. Dunkswell was at that moment in his berth, at
least half drunk, and a bottle labelled "Old Bourbon"
stood on his wash-stand. The odor in the
state-room was quite equal to that of a third-class
bar-room. Why had E. Dunkswell taken those letters?
In what manner did they concern him? This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
was an interesting, and rather exciting question to
me, and it suggested other pertinent inquiries. He
had not taken his passage till after I applied for
mine. He had practically insisted that I should occupy
the same state-room with him. Why did he
refuse to exchange berths with Mr. Solomons? Why
did he labor so hard to become intimate with me?</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions was plain
enough to me after a little consideration. He was an
agent of Tom Thornton. He had been sent to worm
himself into my friendship, and take from me the
will, which Tom probably supposed I carried in my
pocket, and the other papers which would enable me
to find my mother. Force and violence had failed,
and Tom had resorted to cunning and stratagem.</p>

<p>E. Dunkswell had drank too much wine at dinner,
and too much whiskey after dinner. Perhaps the
frequent libations he had taken increased his zeal,
but they diminished his discretion in a corresponding
ratio. He had begun his work too soon, and had
done it in a very bungling manner. If whiskey was a
curse to him, it was a blessing to me, for in his sober
senses he would not have exposed himself and his
plans by robbing my valise so early on the voyage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>My blood was up; and while I sat on the sofa
debating whether or not I should take E. Dunkswell
by the throat, and "have it out" with him, he got
out of his berth, and took another pull at the bottle.
It was plain that he had no intention of keeping
sober, and I concluded to wait and let the whiskey
help me do my work.</p>

<p>"How is it, old boy?" said he.</p>

<p>"First rate," I replied.</p>

<p>"How zhe head?"</p>

<p>"Sou'-sou'-west, half-west."</p>

<p>"I mus' zgo on deck an zee to it."</p>

<p>He put on his hat, straightened himself up, and
walked out of the room as well as he could. I
locked the door after him. If his key would fit
my valise, it followed that my key would fit his
trunk. I tried the experiment, and the logic failed.
It was evident that he had other keys, or that he
was a regular operator, and carried implements for
the purpose of picking locks. I was not sure that
the papers he had stolen from me were in his trunk;
but I was determined to have them before morning,
if I had to split the trunk open.</p>

<p>I unlocked the door, and presently E. Dunkswell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
staggered into the room. The first thing he did was
to drink from the bottle again.</p>

<p>"Thornton&mdash;hic!" said he. "You're a good fellow.
Take some whisk&mdash;good whisk zever you drank&mdash;hic&mdash;or
any other man. Take zome whisk."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you; I never drink it."</p>

<p>"You dzon't zrink whisk! Then you are a to-tzeetler."</p>

<p>"I am," I replied, inclined to encourage him in
talking, hopeful that he would say something which
would be of use to me.</p>

<p>"I'm not a to-tzeetler. My name's Dzunkswell.
You're a to-tzeetler, and I mus zrink for boze of
us;" and, suiting the action to the word, he imbibed
again. "If I'm zrunk to-night, 'll be your fault, Thornton&mdash;'cause
I've got to zrink for boze of us."</p>

<p>But he was no longer in condition even to drink
for both of us. He had already taken more than
he could carry, and he had just sense enough left to
roll into his berth, all in a heap. I straightened him
out a little, and in a few moments I heard him snoring
in his drunken slumbers. The time for action
had come, and I was determined to search him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
his effects till I found the precious letters. I first
examined his pockets, but without finding the papers.
The key of his trunk, however, I did find. It was
exceedingly disagreeable business to me; and if only
my own rights, instead of the life, liberty, and happiness
of my mother, had been at stake, I should
have taken a less direct and more uncertain method
of enforcing them.</p>

<p>The trunk, which he had placed under his berth, I
pulled out into the floor. With trembling hand and
eager heart I opened it. The package of letters had
been thrust down between the clothing and one end,
evidently in great haste, for I had probably disturbed
him when I came to the door. After assuring myself
I had all that belonged to me, I closed the
trunk,&mdash;for I had no desire to explore it any further,&mdash;and
restored it to its place under the berth.
The drunken agent of Tom Thornton still snored
unconscious of my proceedings.</p>

<p>I took the precaution to place the Bunyard letter
in my money-belt; the others, being of minor importance,
I put in my valise again. I looked at the
miserable being who lay groaning and uneasy in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
stupor of intoxication. The state-room was not fit
for the occupancy of a decent person. The fumes of
the whiskey were sickening to me, and I could no
longer stay there. Taking my valise in my hand, I
left it, resolved not to be the room-mate of such a
filthy swine.</p>

<p>I deposited my valise in a corner in the passageway,
and went into the saloon. Mr. Solomons was
there, and expressed his surprise at seeing me. I
freely told him what had transpired in the state-room.</p>

<p>"And you recovered your papers&mdash;did you?"
said he.</p>

<p>"I did; I was satisfied the fellow had been sent
by Tom Thornton, to prevent me from finding my
mother."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, my lad. You must keep away
from him now."</p>

<p>"That I shall certainly do, for I would rather
sleep in a hog-pen than in such a place as that
state-room."</p>

<p>"You shall not sleep there," replied my friend, decidedly;
"come with me."</p>

<p>I followed him below, and he conducted me to his
own room, and told me to occupy his berth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what will you do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I will take your berth, and the fellow shall not
turn the room into a pigsty."</p>

<p>I objected to this arrangement, and offered to
sleep on a sofa in the saloon; but Mr. Solomons
persisted, assuring me he should take good care of
himself, and would not submit to any annoyance
from his room-mate. As soon as this point was
settled, I retired, and slept soundly till the breakfast
gong roused me from my tired slumbers. When
I went to the saloon, E. Dunkswell was in his place
at the table; but Mr. Solomons had taken the place
which I occupied the day before, so as to bring himself
between the obnoxious individual and myself.</p>

<p>E. Dunkswell did not appear to have a ravenous
appetite. He looked sheepish and disconcerted; and
I could not tell whether it was on account of his
spree, because he had discovered the loss of the papers,
or because he found in the morning that he had
a new room-mate. My friend was cheerful and happy,
and so was I. We talked and laughed as though
E. Dunkswell had been tipsy, or out of existence.
We took no notice of him, either by word or look.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and we adjourned to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
hurricane deck to enjoy the cool air and the prospect
of the ever-throbbing ocean. Tom Thornton's agent
soon followed us. He walked up and down the uneasy
deck; and occasionally glanced at me. I thought
he had something to say to me; but he evidently
did not like my close intimacy with Mr. Solomons.
During the day, I occasionally saw him, and he always
appeared to be watching me; but I carefully
avoided him. On the following day, however, I went
forward to the bow alone.</p>

<p>"Passengers not allowed forward of that mark,"
said a sailor, pointing to a chalk line drawn across
the deck. "You are fined, sir."</p>

<p>"What for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For crossing the line."</p>

<p>"Why don't you put up a notice, so that passengers
need not cross it?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Because they wouldn't go over the line if we did,
sir."</p>

<p>"How much is the fine?"</p>

<p>"Anything you please, sir."</p>

<p>It was a practical joke, one of Jack's tricks, and
I paid the fine, amid the laughter of half a dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
passengers, who had already been made victims. As
I retreated, I encountered E. Dunkswell. He looked
sour and savage.</p>

<p>"I want to see you," said he, gruffly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see you," I replied, continuing
on my walk aft.</p>

<p>"You have insulted me," he persisted, putting his
hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Insulted you!" I replied, pausing; for I was
curious to know in what manner I had insulted so
vile a creature as he was.</p>

<p>"You have insulted me!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"You said that before. How?"</p>

<p>"You exchanged berths with that old chap you
run with."</p>

<p>"I don't know that it concerns you if I did."</p>

<p>"It was the same as saying that I am not fit
company for you," said he, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"If it was, it was also saying that you were fit
company for Mr. Solomons," I replied; and I regarded
this as a clincher in the line of argument.</p>

<p>"It was not my pleasure to room with him."</p>

<p>"It is not my pleasure to room with you," I
added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"I consider your conduct as an insult to me, and
I hold you responsible for it."</p>

<p>"All right," I replied, cheerfully. "Hold away."</p>

<p>"If the old fellow don't go back to his room,
there'll be a row."</p>

<p>"The old fellow will do as he pleases about that,"
I added; "but whether he does or not, I shall not
return to your room. I would sleep on the main
truck first."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me again?"</p>

<p>"Insult you again!" I exclaimed, indignantly, for
my blood was up at the idea of a fellow like him
putting on such airs. "No decent man could stay
in the room with you, as you were the first night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"You were as drunk as an owl, and made the
room smell like a low groggery."</p>

<p>"I confess that I took a little too much that night,"
said he, suddenly changing his front, and apparently
relieved to find that this was the objection to him.
"I shall not do it again."</p>

<p>"I shall keep away from you, any how," I added.</p>

<p>"Will you?" he continued, angry again. "That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
night I lost some valuable articles from my trunk.
No one but my room-mate could have taken them.
I intend to complain to the captain."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I had a similar experience. I had some
valuable letters taken from my valise; and they could
have been taken only by my room-mate; but I found
them again, and I am satisfied. When you complain
to the captain, one story will be good till another is
told."</p>

<p>Not wishing to talk with him any longer, I walked
aft. He followed me, uttering threats and imprecations,
which I did not heed. E. Dunkswell was a
disappointed man. He had undertaken a mission
which he was not competent to perform. He had
failed by his own folly. If he had kept sober he
might have retained my papers. He evidently felt
his own weakness, and realized that whiskey had
caused him to make a mess of it.</p>

<p>His hostility was excited against me, and during
the rest of the voyage he watched me with an evil
eye, and appeared to be waiting for an opportunity
to do something. For my own part, I felt that there
was a heavy discount on E. Dunkswell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST LANDS AT CROOKHAVEN, AND
PROCEEDS TO LONDON.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WE had a remarkably pleasant and quick passage,
and on the eighth day from New York,
while we were at dinner, I heard the captain say to
a lady who sat near him, that we should be off
Queenstown the next morning, at six or seven
o'clock. I was sorry that we were to approach the
land by night, for I wanted to see it.</div>

<p>"You can see it if you choose to sit up all night,"
laughed Mr. Solomons.</p>

<p>"It will be rather too dark to see anything," I
added.</p>

<p>"Not at all; it is about the full of the moon, and
it will be as light as day. You can turn in early,
and sleep four or five hours. We shall be off Crookhaven,
where they throw over the despatch bag,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
about five or six hours before we stop off Queenstown;
that will make it about two in the morning.
If you will retire at eight, it will give you six
hours' sleep; and you can turn in again and finish
your nap after you have seen enough of the shore."</p>

<p>"I think I will do so, sir. What is the despatch
bag you speak of?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The despatches are put into a barrel and thrown
overboard off Crookhaven, where a steamer picks
them up. They are taken ashore and telegraphed to
London. The despatches are simply the newspapers,
from which the news agent transmits the important
items."</p>

<p>After dinner, when I went on deck, I found the
carpenter preparing a flour barrel for the despatches.
A quantity of sand was put in the bottom to make
it stand up straight in the water. A pole was set
up in the barrel, like the mast of a vessel, to the
top of which a blue-light was attached, to be ignited
when it was thrown overboard, in order to enable the
despatch steamer to find it readily. In the daytime
a red rag is sometimes attached to it, I was
told by the carpenter. The papers were placed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a water-tight can, and imbedded in the sand in the
barrel.</p>

<p>At sea almost anything creates an excitement, and
the preparing the despatch barrel was witnessed by
many persons, among whom I noticed Dunkswell. I
had observed that he listened very attentively to all
that passed between Mr. Solomons and myself at the
dinner table. I did not regard this as very strange,
for all on board were deeply interested in everything
which related to the progress of the steamer.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock I turned in, and went to sleep
very soon. I had before made a trade with one of
the stewards to call me at two o'clock, and at this
hour he waked me. The night was beautiful; the
moon shone brightly on the silver waters, and the
sea was quite smooth. I did not see a single passenger
on the hurricane deck. I made out the outline
of some high hills on the shore, and the glimmer of
a couple of distant lights. Three men were standing
ready to throw over the despatch barrel as soon as
the small steamer should appear.</p>

<p>I was a boy then, and had a boy's curiosity to see
how everything was done. The hurricane deck was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
surrounded by an open railing, on the top of which
I placed myself, where I could see over the stern of
the ship. I was so accustomed to the water, and to
high places, that I had no fear of anything. I put
my legs over, and sat facing astern.</p>

<p>"Don't sit there, young man; you'll certainly fall
overboard," said the officer of the deck, who had
come aft to see that the barrel was ready to go
over.</p>

<p>"No danger of that," I replied, easily.</p>

<p>"Better get down, and come on board," added a
quarter-master.</p>

<p>"I'm an old sailor," I answered, laughing at the
caution.</p>

<p>"Steamer on the port bow!" cried some one forward.</p>

<p>"Ready with the barrel!" called the officer.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir!" replied the quarter-master, whose
attention was thus turned away from me.</p>

<p>The barrel was lifted over the rail, near where I
sat, and held there till the order should be given to
let it go. The quarter-master had a match in his
hand to light the fireworks. Over on my right I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
could now see the little steamer, rising and falling
on the long swells of the placid, moonlit ocean.</p>

<p>"Light up, Murray!" called the officer, when the
despatch boat was but a short distance from the
steamer.</p>

<p>The blue-light hissed and flared up when the match
was applied, shedding its livid glare upon the weather-stained
faces of the seamen.</p>

<p>"Over with it!" shouted the officer.</p>

<p>It soused into the water, and I leaned forward to
observe the splash.</p>

<p>"Stand by the fore-braces!" called the officer; and
the seamen rushed forward to execute the order.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard a step behind me on the
deck; but I was too much absorbed in watching the
blue-light on the barrel to heed anything else. The
next instant I found myself spinning through the
air, and then plunging deep down into the bosom of
the tranquil sea. I was in my element now, though
it was rather too much element; but I struck out,
as soon as I rose to the surface, for the blue-light.
I shouted for help; but the great steamer seemed to
be hard of hearing, and went on her way as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
nothing had happened. I swam as I had never
swum before, and reached the barrel just as the despatch
boat stopped her wheels to pick it up.</p>

<p>"Steamer ahoy!" I shouted</p>

<p>"Who's there?" called a voice from her deck.</p>

<p>"Man overboard!" I replied, puffing from the violence
of my exertions.</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"On the barrel."</p>

<p>"I see him!" said one of the hands, as the bow of
the boat ran up to the barrel.</p>

<p>A rope was thrown to me, and I was assisted on
board.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Did you fall overboard
from the steamer?" asked a well-dressed, gentlemanly
man, on the deck of the boat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I suppose I did; I don't know exactly
how it happened," I replied, spitting the salt water
out of my mouth.</p>

<p>"You are fortunate to fall over just as the despatch
boat was approaching you."</p>

<p>"Probably I shouldn't have fallen overboard if I
had not been watching the barrel so intently."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"What shall we do for you?" asked the gentleman,
kindly. "Come into the cabin, and get your
wet clothes off."</p>

<p>The crew of the steamer were busy getting in the
barrel, and my new friend, who was full of sympathy,
conducted me to the cabin, where I divested myself
of a portion of my clothing. By this time the
despatches had been secured, and the captain came
below. He gave me a flannel shirt and a pair of
trowsers, and sent me to his state-room to put them
on. I was very much alarmed about the safety of
the contents of my money-belt; but, on removing it,
I found that the oiled silk, in which the bank notes
and the papers had been enclosed to prevent the
perspiration of my body from injuring them, had protected
them in a great measure. A few drops of
water had penetrated through the folds of the silk,
but no harm was done to the documents or the
money.</p>

<p>I wrung out the belt and put it on again, after I
had wiped myself dry. Clothing myself in the flannel
shirt and pants, both of which were "a mile too
big for me," I returned to the cabin. The captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
then carried all my clothes to the furnace-room to be
dried, just as the boat stopped at Crookhaven to
land the despatches.</p>

<p>"I suppose you would like to follow the steamer,
young man," said the gentleman who had been so
kind to me.</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed!" I replied, eagerly; for I
feared that the accident would render my mission to
England fruitless.</p>

<p>"You are extremely fortunate again," added he.
"This steamer is to proceed to Kinsale with me immediately."</p>

<p>Mr. Carmichael, the gentleman who addressed me,
proved to be an agent of the telegraph company,
who had come down to this station to look after its
affairs. His business was finished, and he was in a
hurry to reach London; but it was twenty miles, by
a rough and tiresome road, to any public conveyance,
and the steamer had been placed at his disposal.
He told me he should have gone the day
before, but the boat was required to be on the watch
for the despatches.</p>

<p>"I hope to reach Kinsale in time for the nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
o'clock train to Cork," said he. "If we do, you will
not be much behind the steamer. Had you any
friends on board?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, one gentleman," I replied.</p>

<p>"Of course he will be troubled about you. Perhaps
you would like to telegraph to him."</p>

<p>I was pleased with this suggestion, for I felt that
I had one good friend on board of the ship who
would worry about me in the morning, when my
absence was discovered. Knowing that Mr. Solomons
intended to stay at the Washington Hotel in
Liverpool, if he had to wait for a train, and at
Morley's in London while in the metropolis, I wrote
a brief despatch, to be forwarded to each, which
Mr. Carmichael sent to the office. The steamer then
proceeded on her trip to Kinsale, at three o'clock.</p>

<p>I was very grateful to Mr. Carmichael and the
captain for their kindness to me, and I did not fail
to express my obligations in the strongest terms. A
berth in the cabin was assigned to me, and as the
run to Kinsale would occupy between five and six
hours, I turned in to finish my nap. I was too
much excited to sleep, and I could not help thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of what had happened to me. I had never done
such a thing as to fall overboard without some help.
Though I was not positive, I had a very strong impression
that I had felt something on my back, while
watching the blue-light on the barrel. Whether it
had been the swaying of the signal halyards against
me, or the push of a human hand, I was not certain;
but I could not help believing that E. Dunkswell
had helped me to my involuntary bath. I
don't know now, but I still believe it.</p>

<p>I had no doubt he had been instructed by Tom
Thornton to see Bunyard before I did. Whether
the villain intended to drown me, or only to delay
my arrival in London, I have no means of knowing.
Doubtless he intended to land at Queenstown, and
get to London eight or ten hours before the passengers
who proceeded to Liverpool in the steamer. I
went to sleep at last, satisfied that I was again the
victim of a conspiracy. But when I was awakened
at half past eight, in Kinsale harbor, I was also satisfied
that the way of the wicked shall not prosper.</p>

<p>My clothes, thoroughly dried, were brought to me,
and I dressed myself in season to land for the train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
for Cork, where we arrived as soon as the mails and
those of the passengers who landed there. I breakfasted
with Mr. Carmichael at the Royal Victoria,
and at twenty minutes of eleven we took the train
for Dublin, where we arrived at half past three.
Though I made diligent search among the passengers,
I could not find E. Dunkswell, and I concluded
that he had gone to Liverpool in the steamer. In
the evening I took the train for Kingstown, where I
embarked in the steamer for Holyhead, at which
place I again took a train, and at seven o'clock on
Saturday morning was at Morley's, in London, at
least eight hours before my fellow-voyagers could
arrive.</p>

<p>After I had breakfasted, I took the Bunyard letter
from my money-belt, and hastened to find Old Jewry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST VISITS STONY STRATFORD, AND
E. DUNKSWELL COMES TO GRIEF.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THOUGH I was in a strange land, and in the
midst of the wonders of the Old World, I had
but little curiosity to see the grand sights which
London can present. I had been whirled through
Ireland, Wales, and England to the great metropolis,
part of the time by daylight; and though I had kept
my eyes wide open, I realized that my mission was
higher and grander than studying landscapes, and
wandering through the vaulted arches of old cathedrals.</div>

<p>When Mr. Carmichael told me, early in the morning,
that I was in England, the thought that I was
in the same country with my mother thrilled me
with delight, which, however, was not unmingled with
apprehension lest I should seek and not find; lest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
disease and death had robbed me of her I sought.
At the station in Euston Square I had parted with
the telegraph agent, with many thanks for his kindness.
I took his address, hoping that at some future
time I might be able to reciprocate the attention he
had bestowed upon me. I may as well say here that
Mr. Carmichael afterwards came to the United States,
and that I helped him to a situation which paid him
ten times the salary he had ever before received,
when he was as grateful to me as I had been to
him.</p>

<p>Morley's Hotel is in Trafalgar Square, at one end
of the Strand. I had looked up Old Jewry in the
Post-office Directory. The hall porter of the hotel
had given me general directions, and I walked out
into the Strand, and took an omnibus with the word
"Bank" painted on it. On the top of the London
omnibus there is a double seat along the middle, on
which the passengers sit facing the buildings on each
side of the street. I occupied one of these places.
The Bank of England was my objective point, for
Old Jewry was near it. I passed St. Paul's, whose
towering height and blackened walls I recognized,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and entered Cheapside&mdash;a name which sounded quite
familiar to me. I descended from my perch when
the omnibus stopped, and after several inquiries found
the place I sought.</p>

<p>Old Jewry was nothing but a narrow lane, and I
had no difficulty in finding the number of Mr. Bunyard's
office. I followed his name, repeated on the
walls, up three flights of stairs; and by the time I
had reached the third floor, I came to the conclusion
that my uncle's agent was a person of no great consequence.
He was fortunately in his room, a little
apartment ten feet square, with no furniture but a
desk and two chairs. Mr. Bunyard was a man of
fifty or more. He stopped writing when I entered,
and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bunyard?" I asked, as politely as I could,
while my heart leaped with emotion.</p>

<p>"The same," replied he.</p>

<p>I handed him the letter, which he opened at once.
He took from it a bill of exchange, which seemed to
light up his face with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I am very happy to hear from my friend Mr.
Thornton. I hope he is quite well. He does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
mention the bearer of this letter," continued the
agent, bestowing an inquiring look upon me.</p>

<p>"He was not aware, when he wrote the letter, that
I should be the bearer of it," I replied, evasively.
"My name is Thornton."</p>

<p>"I am happy to meet you, Mr. Thornton," he
added.</p>

<p>"How is Mrs. Thornton now?" I inquired, boldly,
though my heart almost sank within me, when I put
the question.</p>

<p>He looked at me&mdash;appeared to hesitate; but a
glance at the letter and the bill of exchange I had
brought apparently reassured him. Doubtless he concluded,
as I supposed he would, that it was all right,
since I came directly from his employer, and was the
bearer of a payment to him.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Thornton is quite as well as usual," he replied.</p>

<p>"I wish to see her," I continued, squarely.</p>

<p>"Did your father desire you to see her?" he
asked, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course he did," I answered, which was quite
true, though my conscience charged me with deceiving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
him. "I wish to make an arrangement with
her."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"It would be proper that any arrangement with
her should be made through me," he added, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Of course, the actual business will be done
through you," I replied, magnanimously.</p>

<p>"Certainly it should be, for I have served Mr.
Thornton very faithfully for many years in this
matter, and at a very reasonable compensation."</p>

<p>"I know that he appreciates your devotion, and is
willing to do the right thing by you," I continued at
a venture; and I thought there was no harm in
committing my uncle to a liberal policy.</p>

<p>"I have been paid only one hundred pound a year
for my services, and that only for a brief period.
Really I must insist, before you see the poor lady,
that you should explain your business with her."</p>

<p>"My time is short," I replied, rather <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bruskly'">brusquely</ins>. "I
wish to know for what sum, cash down, you will
terminate your relations with the lady."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will require some consideration," replied he,
apparently pleased with the idea.</p>

<p>"Of course your client in this matter is entirely
in your power. He cannot shake you off, and whatever
arrangement is made with the lady shall be
done through you. Now, if you will give me her
address, I will go and see her, and in the mean time
you can make up your estimate of the sum that
ought to be paid to you," I said, with the most business-like
air I could assume.</p>

<p>"I will do it," replied he, after some hesitation;
and he wrote the address on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>How eagerly I took it! I felt then that the battle
had been fought and won. On the paper was
written: "Mrs. Thornton, Stony Stratford, Bucks.
Inquire for Mrs. Challis." My business with Mr. Bunyard
was done, and I hastened away, though he insisted
upon my remaining longer. I think he was
sorry he had given me the address before I left the
room.</p>

<p>Being near the banker's, I drew fifty pounds, which
was paid without question.</p>

<p>I went back to Morley's, and ascertained that Stony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Stratford was on the road to Rugby, and that I must
leave the train at Wolverton station. I called a Hansom
cab, and reached Euston Square depot just in
time for the train. I will not attempt to describe
the emotions which agitated me as I sped over the
country. I was on the point of meeting my mother,
and though the rich panorama of an English landscape
was passing before me, I could think of nothing
else. In two hours I reached the Wolverton station,
and there learned that it was four and a half miles
to Stony Stratford. I engaged a team to take me
over. My driver inquired till he found the house of
Mrs. Challis. It was a small and mean dwelling,
and I began to feel indignant that my mother was
compelled to live in such a place. My knock, under
the influence of this feeling, was a very decided one.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Thornton at home?" I inquired&mdash;my
utterance almost choked by agitation&mdash;of the woman
who came to the door.</p>

<p>"She is, but she don't see any one," replied the
woman, sourly, as she abruptly closed the door in
my face.</p>

<p>I rapped again, and my knuckles not proving sufficient,
I used my boot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't see Mrs. Thornton!" snarled the
woman, angrily, as she opened the door a little
crack.</p>

<p>"I can and will!" I replied. "Mr. Bunyard sent
me."</p>

<p>"O, did he?" she added, opening the door.</p>

<p>"Here's the paper he gave me."</p>

<p>She looked at it, and invited me to enter. My
limbs trembled under me as I walked into the
room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Thornton is out in the garden, but I will
call her," said Mrs. Challis&mdash;or I supposed it was she.</p>

<p>"Never mind calling her. I will see her in the
garden," I added, going out of the back door, which
was open, without waiting for the woman's permission.</p>

<p>Walking in the back part of the garden I discovered
a lady, thin and pale, dressed in coarse but
neat garments. It was my mother. I could hardly
control myself. My eyes filled with tears as I
looked at her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Thornton?" I asked, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Thornton," replied she, gazing curiously
at me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you know Amos Thornton?" I continued,
not daring to tell her who I was.</p>

<p>"To my sorrow I do," she replied, shaking her
head.</p>

<p>"I have heard that you had a son."</p>

<p>"He is gone&mdash;why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"He is dead," said she, sadly.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"For a long time I would not believe it."</p>

<p>"I think it is a mistake."</p>

<p>Her chest heaved with emotion, and the tears
flowed down her pale cheek. She gazed at me
a moment, and then threw her arms around my
neck.</p>

<p>"You are my son&mdash;I know you are!" sobbed she.</p>

<p>"My mother!" was all I could say; and we wept
for many minutes in silence, closely folded in each
other's arms.</p>

<p>When I raised my head, Mrs. Challis was standing
by us. She had a troubled look, as though she
feared something had gone wrong.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" she asked; but neither
of us took any notice of her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have hoped all the time that you were not
dead," said my mother, smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>"I must return to London immediately, and you
must go with me, mother," I continued.</p>

<p>"To London!" exclaimed Mrs. Challis. "Indeed
she must not go to London!"</p>

<p>"Indeed she must!" I added, as decidedly as though
I meant to break through a stone wall, if need be.
"Get ready as quick as you can, mother, for there
is not more than time enough for us to reach the
station."</p>

<p>"I say she cannot go!" interposed Mrs. Challis.</p>

<p>"And I say she can and shall! Get your clothes,
mother."</p>

<p>"There is three pound five due for her board,"
added the landlady.</p>

<p>"Give me the bill, and I will pay it."</p>

<p>My mother seemed to be bewildered, but I led her
to the house, and urged her to prepare for her journey.
Mrs. Challis, after I had paid her bill, continued
to object to the departure of her boarder. I told
her if she wished to keep out of trouble, the less she
said, the better it would be for her. My poor mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
had been so long a prisoner, that she was confused
by the sudden change in her prospects. I went into
her room, and assisted her in packing her meagre
wardrobe. She had put on a well-worn black silk
dress, and an antiquated bonnet lay on the table. I
told her to take only such clothing as she would
need immediately, for I saw that most of her wearing
apparel was not worth the transportation. Having
thrust these articles into a carpet-bag, I hurried
her out of the house to the carriage which was waiting
for me at the door.</p>

<p>We reached the station in time for the London
train. My mother was excited, and I did not permit
her to speak of the past. I kept up a lively conversation,
and did not allow her to think of her wrongs
and her sorrows. On our arrival, we went to Morley's,
where I obtained a room for her. Mr. Solomons
had just arrived. He had received the telegraphic
despatch in Liverpool. I hastily told him my story,
and what I had done since my arrival in London.</p>

<p>"My dear boy!" exclaimed he, "you have done
wonders. I was sure you were lost overboard. No
one had seen you, or heard anything of you; only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the officers and sailors had warned you not to sit
on the rail."</p>

<p>"Where is Dunkswell?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He came to London in the same train I did."</p>

<p>At my request Mr. Solomons accompanied me to
the office of Bunyard. When we entered, Dunkswell
was there. Both of them had found out that
"somebody" was smart.</p>

<p>"Young man, you have deceived me!" said Bunyard,
savagely.</p>

<p>"The wicked deceiveth himself," I replied, in words
better than my own. "I have called to say that
you need give yourself no further trouble in regard
to Mrs. Thornton. I wish to tell you now that she
is in London, and that she is my mother."</p>

<p>"I must be paid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paid!" I interposed. "I'll pay you! We are not
far from Newgate, and if my mother is willing, I will
help you to lodgings there. As for you, E. Dunkswell,
you can go back to Tom Thornton, and tell
him you have burnt your fingers. You helped me
overboard."</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed he, with quivering lip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he?" asked Mr. Solomons.</p>

<p>"I believe he did; perhaps I can prove it."</p>

<p>E. Dunkswell sank into a chair, pale as a ghost.
Bunyard looked cheap, and said no more about being
paid, and I retired from the presence of my defeated
foes. Mr. Solomons insisted that they should
be punished, especially Dunkswell, but I told him I
could not prove that he had pushed me overboard;
and I could not stay in London long enough to follow
up the criminal. I engaged passage in the Saturday
steamer for my mother and myself before returning
to the hotel.</p>

<p>We remained four days in London, during which
time I kept my mother's mind fully occupied in replenishing
her wardrobe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ERNEST RETURNS TO PARKVILLE WITH HIS
MOTHER, AND THE STORY ENDS ON THE SHORES
OF LAKE ADIENO.</h3>


<div class='cap'>IF E. Dunkswell had not helped me overboard,
as I think he did, he might have reached London
before I did, and thus defeated me, at least for
a time. Twice had he confused and confounded his
own schemes. Bunyard, deceived by the letter I had
brought from my uncle, gave me the address of my
mother. If not before, he learned his blunder when
Dunkswell arrived. I could fancy the confusion with
which they confronted each other when the facts
came out. But it was "all up" with them. They
had been "whipped out," and I was satisfied. I
did not wish to prosecute them, because it would
delay me, and because it would expose our family
affairs, and subject my mother to more excitement
than she could bear.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>She was weak and nervous, and I did not encourage
her to talk much of the past. I went with her
to Westminster Abbey, the Tower of London, and
other places with which she was familiar. On Friday
afternoon we bade adieu to Mr. Solomons, and
went to Liverpool. My mother was now entirely
changed in appearance. She had laid aside her
worn-out black silk and her unfashionable bonnet.
She looked like a lady, and she was one. I was
proud of her. The future was now full of hope and
joy to me, and I was the happiest young man in the
world.</p>

<p>On Saturday we sailed for home. My mother
seemed then to feel that she was out of the reach
of the enemy who had persecuted her for so many
years. She overcame her nervousness, and her
strength increased every day. I had purchased a
rocking-chair in Liverpool for her use on the hurricane
deck, and every pleasant day we sat together
there. On these days my mother told me what she
had suffered. I had not permitted her to do so
before, anxious as I was to learn the facts. I will
state them briefly, as I derived them from these
conversations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>My mother was born in Paris of English parents,
but both of them died before she was eighteen. She
was well educated, and being left without any means
of support, she became a governess in an American
family residing in the city. Here my father made
her acquaintance, and married her. They lived in
Philadelphia three years, and I was born there.
When I was two years old, my mother's only relative,
a bachelor uncle, died in London, leaving a considerable
estate. She was notified that a portion of
the property would go to her by will. My father's
health was poor, and he had decided to take up
his residence for a few years in the south of France,
and my mother's affairs induced him to hasten his
departure.</p>

<p>Leaving his property in the hands of his brother
Amos, he sailed for Europe, accompanied by his wife
and son. On his arrival in London he found the
affairs of my mother's uncle in great confusion. Another
will had been produced, in which my mother's
name was not mentioned. My father believed there
was fraud, or that the second will had been made
under illegal pressure, and he contested it. The proceedings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
detained him in London a year; at the end
of which time, having lost the case, his health was
entirely broken down by fatigue and excitement.
Conscious that he should not live to return to his
native land, he sent for his brother Amos, to assist
him in settling his worldly affairs. The will was
made, and he died.</p>

<p>His death was a terrible blow to my mother, and
being of a very sensitive nature, it affected her reason.
She became insane, and Amos sent her to a
private asylum, within a month after my father's
funeral. Until this time, probably, the brother had
no intention of defrauding her and her son. Amos
had all the property of my father in his own hands.
The temptation was great, and finding that my
mother's health did not improve, he decided to return
to America, with his son Thomas, who accompanied
him, taking me with him in charge of a
nurse. The care of my mother was left to Mr.
Bunyard, who was to pay her bills. My mother
was the inmate of the asylum for two years, though
she was cured in less than one.</p>

<p>She was discharged, and Mr. Bunyard conveyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
her to a small village in Hampshire, assuring her that
Amos would come for her soon; but year after year
she hoped to see her son, till she was told that he
was dead. Her residence was changed every two or
three years, for what reason she did not know; but
every time it was for the worse, until her food,
clothing, and accommodations were not better than
those of the poorest class. I readily perceived that
it was to enable Mr. Bunyard to make more money
out of his victim, by paying less for her board. My
uncle sent him two hundred pounds a year, but he
did not spend fifty upon her.</p>

<p>My mother was never allowed to have any money,
and could not help herself. She was continually told
that her mind was disordered, especially when she
spoke of her husband's property and her son.</p>

<p>This was the substance of my mother's story, and
I readily supplied what was wanting. My uncle had
gone with me to the cottage on Lake Adieno, and
Tom Thornton had taken possession of the property.
The will had simply been kept out of sight.</p>

<p>"Mother, you are safe now," was my oft-repeated
remark to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that I am; and I thank God for giving
me such a noble and devoted son," was her reply.</p>

<p>We enjoyed every day of the passage in talking
over the past and the future. I told her everything
I had ever done and said with the utmost minuteness.
I described my life at the cottage, my excursions
on the lake, all my friends, and related the
history of "Breaking Away." In twelve days we
reached New York. As soon as we had taken
rooms at a hotel, I hastened with my mother to see
Kate Loraine.</p>

<p>"O, Ernest Thornton! I am so glad to see you!"
exclaimed she.</p>

<p>"My mother, Kate," I replied proudly.</p>

<p>"I am so delighted!" cried Kate, seizing her hand.
"Now you must tell me all about it, Ernest Thornton."</p>

<p>I told her all about it, and she wondered, ejaculated,
and wept.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Thornton, your son is the best boy in all the
world, and I love him&mdash;I love him as though he
were my own brother," said she, warmly.</p>

<p>"I am very proud of him," replied my mother, as
she smiled upon me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," I added, feeling my cheeks glow.
"What has happened, Kate, since I went away."</p>

<p>"Mr. Windleton has returned, and Uncle Freeman
is to be my guardian. He had a very disagreeable
meeting with Mrs. Loraine, but she cannot help herself."</p>

<p>We spent the evening at the house, and the next
day we started for Parkville. How my heart beat
when the carriage in which we rode over from Romer
passed the cottage of my uncle! We went to
the house of Mr. Hale first.</p>

<p>"Bob, my dear fellow!" I exclaimed, when he
entered the room; and in spite of boyish prejudices
against the operation, I could not help hugging him.
"My mother, Bob," I added, before he had time
to say anything.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Ernest&mdash;upon my word I
am. I am happy to meet you," he added, bowing
to my mother.</p>

<p>She took his hand, and told him she knew him as
her son's best friend. Mr. Hale soon made his appearance,
and gave us a hearty welcome. He said
some very pleasant things to me, which my modesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
will not permit me to repeat, though I have shamed
that quality sometimes in this memoir. We talked of
business then. I told him I did not wish to injure
my uncle, however much he had injured my mother
and myself.</p>

<p>"Your uncle is evidently under the influence of his
son," added Mr. Hale, "and it may be necessary to
take some decided steps."</p>

<p>"You are a lawyer, sir, and I leave the matter
entirely with you; but I hope you will make it as
easy as you can for uncle Amos, for I am pretty
sure Tom is the author of the mischief."</p>

<p>"Our action must depend upon the position they
take. It is best for us to see your uncle without
delay. If Tom hears of your arrival, he may take
the money and leave the country. It will be well
for you to see him first; I will follow you soon,"
said Mr. Hale.</p>

<p>I procured a carryall at the stable, and drove my
mother to the cottage. Old Betsey was delighted to
see me. Leaving my mother in the parlor, I went
to the door of my uncle's library and knocked.</p>

<p>"Ernest!" exclaimed he, starting back.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I have come to see you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;" He paused, his lips quivered, and his
frame trembled.</p>

<p>"You are not glad to see me?" I added.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you&mdash;more so than you
can think. But how is it I see you? Thomas told
me you started for England, and was lost overboard
on the passage."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that?" I demanded, astonished;
and I saw at once that E. Dunkswell, on the arrival
of the steamer at Queenstown, where a letter
could be mailed, had written to his employer.</p>

<p>And Tom Thornton at that moment believed I
was lying at the bottom of the sea, no more to disturb
him, or threaten his ill-gotten possessions. I told my
uncle that my life had been preserved.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said he, so earnestly that I believed
he was sincere. "I feared that Thomas, through his
agent, had committed a crime greater than mine."</p>

<p>"If the intention makes the crime, I think he did
commit it. Where is Tom Thornton?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He is here to-day," replied my uncle, going to
the window and calling his son, who was walking
by the lake. "You have been to England, Ernest?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>He trembled all over, and I pitied him.</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>"It was needless for you to go there. If you had
listened to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was not needless. My mother is in the parlor
now."</p>

<p>"Your mother!" gasped he, springing from his
chair, and then falling back again.</p>

<p>"You shall see her."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Ernest!"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. I opened it, and
Tom Thornton entered. He saw me, and turned pale.
His victim had risen from the depths of the ocean
to confront him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Ernest," stammered he.</p>

<p>"I am here. E. Dunkswell was a fool as well as
a knave."</p>

<p>"What shall be done?" groaned my uncle.</p>

<p>"I was told that you were lost overboard," said
Tom, with a struggle to recover his self-possession.</p>

<p>"E. Dunkswell pushed me overboard; but that act
proved to be my salvation. I won't trouble you
with particulars. My mother is in the parlor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mother!" exclaimed Tom; and from the
height of guilty confidence he fell to the depth of
hopeless despair.</p>

<p>"What shall be done?" repeated my uncle, in
hollow tones.</p>

<p>"Justice must be done," I replied.</p>

<p>"You have been smart, Ernest," added Tom, with
a sepulchral laugh. "How can we settle this business?"</p>

<p>"By paying over to Mr. Hale every dollar mentioned
in my father's will," I replied.</p>

<p>"You are hard, Ernest."</p>

<p>"But I am your guardian and trustee, Ernest,"
said my uncle.</p>

<p>Tom said half the money was spent, and offered
to give up fifty thousand dollars in United States
securities.</p>

<p>"Every dollar," I added.</p>

<p>"I will look it over, Ernest, and see what can be
done," replied Tom, moving to the door.</p>

<p>He rushed out, but only to fall into the arms of
my old friend, Mr. Greene, the deputy-sheriff. Mr.
Hale had taken one decisive step. The officer conducted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Tom back to the library, and I went for my
mother. I was afraid my uncle would faint again
when she entered the room, but he did not; and
then I was afraid my mother would faint, she was
so agitated.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton, this is unpleasant business," said
Mr. Hale. "As the attorney for Mrs. Thornton and
her son, I purpose to settle this matter as quietly as
possible. I understand that the property is in the
hands of your son. I procured a warrant for his
arrest on the criminal charge."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" groaned my uncle. "Do not arrest
him."</p>

<p>"When he has paid over every dollar mentioned
in the will of Ezra Thornton, we shall be willing
to say that no one will appear against him. My clients
do not mention nearly a hundred thousand dollars'
income of which you have defrauded them.
These are our best terms."</p>

<p>"That will leave me and my son beggars," whined
my uncle.</p>

<p>"As you would have left your brother's legal
heirs," replied Mr. Hale, sternly. "This poor lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
has suffered twelve years of misery, but she does not
ask you to pay the back income. Moreover, if you
do not accept these terms, I shall be obliged to cause
your arrest on the criminal charge. I shall go to
Philadelphia, present the will for probate, and proceed
against both of you. We have a just claim
against you for two hundred and forty thousand dollars.
We ask for but one hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>The terms were accepted, for Tom was already
under arrest. He informed us then that the stocks
and bonds of my father's estate had yielded him an
income of nine thousand dollars, and that he had
paid three thousand of it to his father. The principal
had not been touched. On the following day,
Mr. Hale, Tom, and the sheriff started for Philadelphia
to recover the funds. They were paid over,
and deposited for safe keeping in a bank. The will
was offered for probate, and we all went to Philadelphia
to attend the Surrogate Court. After a delay
of several months, Mr. Hale was appointed trustee
of the property, in place of Amos Thornton, who
<i>declined</i> the trust.</p>

<p>When the business was done, my uncle seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
be at peace. He had saved money enough from the
income he had appropriated to support him. My
mother and myself had several conversations with
him about our affairs, and he solemnly assured her
that he did not know she was deprived of even the
luxuries of life. He had never made any bargain
with Bunyard, though they understood each other.
He had sent the money to pay her board, agreeing
to give the agent five per cent. for his services. He
had probably made from one hundred to one hundred
and fifty pounds a year out of the business,
and intended, at the right time, to "come down"
on his employer for some thousands.</p>

<p>After the business in Philadelphia was settled, my
mother and I went to Parkville. Mr. Hale built a
cottage for us on the lake, half a mile from the village.
We had plenty of money, and many a poor
person in the town had occasion to bless my mother
for her bounty. We were happy, very happy, for
my mother was all I had hoped and dreamed in the
days of my loneliness. I was the "man of the
house," and my constant study was to make my
mother happy, and to compensate her for the years
of misery she had suffered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard but little of Tom Thornton after the settlement;
but I learned that Mrs. Loraine, when she
found his possessions had melted away, was "not at
home" when he called. I was told, a few years
later, that he kept a gambling saloon and bar-room in
a southern city, but I know not how true the statement
was. My uncle occupied the cottage till his
death, five years after my mother's arrival. I saw
him occasionally, and I had reason to believe that he
repented his crime, and found the true peace. In
his last sickness, my mother, forgetting the wrongs of
the past, was an angel at his bedside. She not only
nursed him, but she read the Bible to him, and
prayed with him; and finally she closed his eyes in
his last sleep.</p>

<p>The Splash was moored in the lake by my mother's
cottage, and I cruised about in her with Bob
Hale, and often with my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Windleton procured the appointment of Mr.
Loraine as Kate's guardian, and I did not often see
her, though she spent a month with us every summer.
Two years after Mr. Hale had paid over to
me the money, when I was twenty-one, according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to my father's will, we made it perpetual summer at
the cottage, for Kate was duly installed as the mistress
of the house. The interesting occasion came
off in Madison Place, and we were delighted by the
presence of Mr. and Mrs. Macombe, Mr. Solomons,
and Mr. Carmichael. Of course Bob Hale "stood
up" with me.</p>

<p>As this last event properly ends our story, I shall
only add, I believe in Kate, and so does my mother.
She always calls me Ernest Thornton, in full.
Though the Splash is now a little shaky in her timbers,
she is still a good boat; and almost every pleasant
afternoon in summer we sail over to Cannondale
in her, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Hale being often passengers.
We try to be faithful to each other, and strive to be
good and true. Though we hope we grow better
and wiser with each year that is mercifully added
to our span, there is still always something of truth
and goodness for us to <span class="smcap">Seek and Find</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No author has come before the public during the present generation who
has achieved a larger and more deserving popularity among young people than
"Oliver Optic." His stories have been very numerous, but they have been
uniformly excellent in moral tone and literary quality. As indicated in the
general title, it is the author's intention to conduct the readers of this entertaining
series "around the world." As a means to this end, the hero of the
story purchases a steamer which he names the "Guardian Mother," and
with a number of guests she proceeds on her voyage.&mdash;<i>Christian Work, N. Y.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Amid such new and varied surroundings it would be surprising indeed if the
author, with his faculty of making even the commonplace attractive, did not
tell an intensely interesting story of adventure, as well as give much information
in regard to the distant countries through which our friends pass, and
the strange peoples with whom they are brought to contact. This book, and
indeed the whole series, is admirably adapted to reading aloud in the family
circle, each volume containing matter which will interest all the members of
the family.&mdash;<i>Boston Budget.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There never has been a more interesting writer in the field of juvenile
literature than Mr. <span class="smcap">W. T. Adams</span>, who, under his well-known pseudonym, is
known and admired by every boy and girl in the country, and by thousands
who have long since passed the boundaries of youth, yet who remember with
pleasure the genial, interesting pen that did so much to interest, instruct, and
entertain their younger years. 'The Blue and the Gray' is a title that is sufficiently
indicative of the nature and spirit of the latest series, while the name
of <span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span> is sufficient warrant of the absorbing style of narrative. This
series is as bright and entertaining as any work that Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span> has yet put
forth, and will be as eagerly perused as any that has borne his name. It would
not be fair to the prospective reader to deprive him of the zest which comes
from the unexpected by entering into a synopsis of the story. A word, however,
should be said in regard to the beauty and appropriateness of the binding,
which makes it a most attractive volume."&mdash;<i>Boston Budget.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Though we are not so young as we once were, we relished these stories
almost as much as the boys and girls for whom they were written. They were
really refreshing, even to us. There is much in them which is calculated to
inspire a generous, healthy ambition, and to make distasteful all reading tending

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, the celebrated and popular writer, familiarly known as <span class="smcap">Oliver

life; and, notwithstanding he has written scores of books, the same freshness
and novelty run through them all. Some people think the sensational element
predominates. Perhaps it does. But a book for young people needs this, and

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This series of six volumes recounts the adventures of two brothers, Tom

The romantic narratives of the fortunes and exploits of the brothers are thrilling

<h3>THE START IN LIFE SERIES. 4 volumes.</h3>

<div class='hang1'><b>A Start in Life:</b> <span class="smcap">A Story of the Genesee Country</span>. By
<span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.00.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In this story the author recounts the hardships of a young lad in his first
endeavor to start out for himself. It is a tale that is full of enthusiasm and
budding hopes. The writer shows how hard the youths of a century ago were
compelled to work. This he does in an entertaining way, mingling fun and
adventures with their daily labors. The hero is a striking example of the
honest boy, who is not too lazy to work, nor too dull to thoroughly appreciate
a joke.</p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>Biding His Time.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.00.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is full of spirit and adventure, and presents a plucky hero who was willing
to 'bide his time,' no matter how great the expectations that he indulged in
from his uncle's vast wealth, which he did not in the least covet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was
left a poor orphan in Ohio at seventeen years of age, and soon after heard of a
rich uncle, who lived near Boston. He sets off on the long journey to Boston,
finds his uncle, an eccentric old man, is hospitably received by him, but seeks
employment in a humble way, and proves that he is a persevering and plucky
young man."&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Kelp Gatherers:</b> <span class="smcap">A Story of the Maine Coast</span>. By
<span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.00.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This book is full of interesting information upon the plant life of the seashore,
and the life of marine animals; but it is also a bright and readable
story, with all the hints of character and the vicissitudes of human life, in
depicting which the author is an acknowledged master.</p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Scarlet Tanager</b>, <span class="smcap">and Other Bipeds</span>. By <span class="smcap">J. T.
Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.00.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Every new story which Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> begins is followed through successive
chapters by thousands who have read and re-read many times his preceding
tales. One of his greatest charms is his absolute truthfulness. He does not
depict little saints, or incorrigible rascals, but just <i>boys</i>. This same fidelity to
nature is seen in his latest book, "The Scarlet Tanager, and Other Bipeds."
There is enough adventure in this tale to commend it to the liveliest reader,
and all the lessons it teaches are wholesome.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE TIDE-MILL STORIES. 6 volumes.</h3>

<div class='hang1'><b>Phil and His Friends.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated.
$1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The hero is the son of a man who from drink got into debt, and, after having
given a paper to a creditor authorizing him to keep the son as a security for
his claim, ran away, leaving poor Phil a bond slave. The story involves a
great many unexpected incidents, some of which are painful, and some comic.
Phil manfully works for a year, cancelling his father's debt, and then escapes.
The characters are strongly drawn, and the story is absorbingly interesting.</p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Tinkham Brothers' Tide-Mill.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>.
Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Tinkham Brothers" were the devoted sons of an invalid mother. The
story tells how they purchased a tide-mill, which afterwards, by the ill-will and
obstinacy of neighbors, became a source of much trouble to them. It tells also
how, by discretion and the exercise of a peaceable spirit, they at last overcame
all difficulties.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge's</span> humor, his fidelity to nature, and story-telling power
lose nothing with years; and he stands at the head of those who are furnishing
a literature for the young, clean and sweet in tone, and always of interest and
value."&mdash;<i>The Continent.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Satin-wood Box.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated.
$1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> has always a purpose in his writings, and this time he
has undertaken to show how very near an innocent boy can come to the guilty
edge and yet be able by fortunate circumstances to rid himself of all suspicion
of evil. There is something winsome about the hero; but he has a singular
way of falling into bad luck, although the careful reader will never feel the
least disposed to doubt his honesty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is the pain and perplexity which
impart to the story its intense interest."&mdash;<i>Syracuse Standard.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Little Master.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is the story of a schoolmaster, his trials, disappointments, and final
victory. It will recall to many a man his experience in teaching pupils, and
in managing their opinionated and self-willed parents. The story has the
charm which is always found in Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge's</span> works.</p>

<p>"Many a teacher could profit by reading of this plucky little schoolmaster."&mdash;<i>Journal
of Education.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>His One Fault.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As for the hero of this story, 'His One Fault' was absent-mindedness. He
forgot to lock his uncle's stable door, and the horse was stolen. In seeking to
recover the stolen horse, he unintentionally stole another. In trying to restore
the wrong horse to his rightful owner, he was himself arrested. After no end
of comic and dolorous adventures, he surmounted all his misfortunes by downright
pluck and genuine good feeling. It is a noble contribution to juvenile
literature."&mdash;<i>Woman's Journal.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>Peter Budstone.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Trowbridge's</span> other books have been admirable and deservedly popular,
but this one, in our opinion, is the best yet. It is a story at once spirited and
touching, with a certain dramatic and artistic quality that appeals to the literary
sense as well as to the story-loving appetite. In it Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> has not
lectured or moralized or remonstrated; he has simply shown boys what they
are doing when they contemplate hazing. By a good artistic impulse we are
not shown the hazing at all; when the story begins, the hazing is already over,
and we are introduced immediately to the results. It is an artistic touch also
that the boy injured is not hurt because he is a fellow of delicate nerves, but because
of his very strength, and the power with which he resisted until overcome
by numbers, and subjected to treatment which left him insane. His insanity
takes the form of harmless delusion, and the absurdity of his ways and talk
enables the author to lighten the sombreness without weakening the moral, in
away that ought to win all boys to his side."&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SILVER MEDAL STORIES. 6 volumes.</h3>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Silver Medal</b>, <span class="smcap">and Other Stories</span>. By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>.
Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There were some schoolboys who had turned housebreakers, and among their
plunder was a silver medal that had been given to one John Harrison by the
Humane Society for rescuing from drowning a certain Benton Barry. Now
Benton Barry was one of the wretched housebreakers. This is the summary
of the opening chapter. The story is intensely interesting in its serious as
well as its humorous parts.</p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>His Own Master.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is a book after the typical boy's own heart. Its hero is a plucky young
fellow, who, seeing no chance for himself at home, determines to make his own
way in the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He sets out accordingly, trudges to the far West, and
finds the road to fortune an unpleasantly rough one."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>"We class this as one of the best stories for boys we ever read. The tone is
perfectly healthy, and the interest is kept up to the end."&mdash;<i>Boston Home
Journal.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>Bound in Honor.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This story is of a lad, who, though not guilty of any bad action, had been an
eye-witness of the conduct of his comrades, and felt "Bound in Honor" not
to tell.</p>

<p>"The glimpses we get of New England character are free from any distortion,
and their humorous phases are always entertaining. Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge's</span>
brilliant descriptive faculty is shown to great advantage in the opening chapter
of the book by a vivid picture of a village fire, and is manifested elsewhere with
equally telling effect."&mdash;<i>Boston Courier.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Pocket Rifle.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A boy's story which will be read with avidity, as it ought to be, it is so
brightly and frankly written, and with such evident knowledge of the temperaments
and habits, the friendships and enmities of schoolboys."&mdash;<i>New York
Mail.</i></p>

<p>"This is a capital story for boys. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> never tells a story poorly.
It teaches honesty, integrity, and friendship, and how best they can be promoted.
It shows the danger of hasty judgment and circumstantial evidence;
that right-doing pays, and dishonesty never."&mdash;<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>The Jolly Rover.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated. $1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This book will help to neutralize the ill effects of any poison which children
may have swallowed in the way of sham-adventurous stories and wildly fictitious
tales. 'The Jolly Rover' runs away from home, and meets life as it is, till he
is glad enough to seek again his father's house. Mr. <span class="smcap">Trowbridge</span> has the
power of making an instructive story absorbing in its interest, and of covering
a moral so that it is easy to take."&mdash;<i>Christian Intelligencer.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'><b>Young Joe</b>, <span class="smcap">and Other Boys</span>. By <span class="smcap">J. T. Trowbridge</span>. Illustrated.
$1.25.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Young Joe," who lived at Bass Cove, where he shot wild ducks, took some
to town for sale, and attracted the attention of a portly gentleman fond of shooting.
This gentleman went duck shooting with Joe, and their adventures were
more amusing to the boy than to the amateur sportsman.</p>

<p>There are thirteen other short stories in the book which will be sure co please
the young folks.</p></div>

pieces in our literature.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Tomlinson, who knows the "ins and outs" of boy nature by heart,
is one of the most entertaining and at the same time one of the most instructive
of living writers of juvenile fiction. In his younger days a
teacher by profession, he has made boys and their idiosyncrasies the absorbing
study of his life, and, with the accumulated experience of years to
aid him, has applied himself to the task of preparing for their mental
delectation a diet that shall be at once wholesome and attractive; and that
his efforts in this laudable direction have been successful is conclusively
proven by his popularity among boy readers.</p>

<b>PRESS NOTICES.</b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Under Dewey at Manila' is a thoroughly timely book, in perfect sympathy with
the patriotism of the day. Its title is conducive to its perusing, and its reading to
anticipation. For the volume is but the first of the Old Glory Series, and the imprint
is that of the famed firm of Lee and Shepard, whose name has been for so many
years linked with the publications of Oliver Optic. As a matter of fact, the story is
right in line with the productions of that gifted and most fascinating of authors, and
certainly there is every cause for congratulation that the stirring events of our recent
war are not to lose their value for instruction through that valuable school which the
late William T. Adams made so individually distinctive.</p>

<p>"Edward Stratemeyer, who is the author of the present work, has proved an extraordinarily
apt scholar, and had the book appeared anonymously there could hardly
have failed of a unanimous opinion that a miracle had enabled the writer of the
famous Army and Navy and other series to resume his pen for the volume in hand.
Mr. Stratemeyer has acquired in a wonderfully successful degree the knack of writing
an interesting educational story which will appeal to the young people, and the
plan of his trio of books as outlined cannot fail to prove both interesting and valuable."&mdash;<i>Boston
Ideas.</i></p>

<p>"Stratemeyer's style suits the boys."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Terhune</span>, <i>Supt. of Public Instruction,
Bergen Co., New Jersey.</i></p>

<p>"'The Young Volunteer in Cuba,' the second of the Old Glory Series, is better
than the first; perhaps it traverses more familiar ground. Ben Russell, the brother
of Larry, who was 'with Dewey,' enlists with the volunteers and goes to Cuba,
where he shares in the abundance of adventure and has a chance to show his courage
and honesty and manliness, which win their reward. A good book for boys, giving
a good deal of information in a most attractive form."&mdash;<i>Universalist Leader.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In 'Richard Dare's Venture,' Edward Stratemeyer has fully sustained his reputation
as an entertaining, helpful, and instructive writer for boys."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Call.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Dare's Venture,' by Edward Stratemeyer, tells the story of a country
lad who goes to New York to earn enough to support his widowed mother and
orphaned sisters. Richard's energy, uprightness of character, and good sense carry
him through some trying experiences, and gain him friends."&mdash;<i>The Churchman</i>,
New York.</p>

<p>"A breezy boy's book is 'Oliver Bright's Search.' The author has a direct, graphic
style, and every healthy minded youth will enjoy the volume."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Commercial
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Dare's Venture' is a fresh, wholesome book to put into a boy's hands."&mdash;<i>St.
Louis Post Dispatch.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Dare's Venture' is a wholesome story of a practical boy who made a
way for himself when thrown upon his own resources."&mdash;<i>Christian Advocate.</i></p>

<p>"It is such books as 'Richard Dare's Venture' that are calculated to inspire
young readers with a determination to succeed in life, and to choose some honorable
walk in which to find that success. The author, Edward Stratemeyer, has shown a
judgment that is altogether too rare in the makers of books for boys, in that he has
avoided that sort of heroics in the picturing of the life of his hero which deals in
adventures of the daredevil sort. In that respect alone the book commends itself to
the favor of parents who have a regard for the education of their sons, but the story
is sufficiently enlivening and often thrilling to satisfy the healthful desires of the
young reader."&mdash;<i>Kansas City Star.</i></p>

<p>"Of standard writers of boys' stories there is quite a list, but those who have not
read any by Edward Stratemeyer have missed a very goodly thing."&mdash;<i>Boston Ideas.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Edward Stratemeyer is in danger of becoming very popular among the
young people of the country."&mdash;<i>Burlington</i> (Iowa) <i>Hawk-eye.</i></p>

<p>"'The Last Cruise of the Spitfire' is of deep interest to the bounding heart of an
enthusiastic boy. The book leaves a good impression on a boy's mind, as it teaches
the triumph of noble deeds and true heroism."&mdash;<i>Kansas City</i> (Mo.) <i>Times.</i></p>

<p>"Let us mention in passing two admirable books for boys, 'Reuben Stone's Discovery'
and 'Oliver Bright's Search,' by Edward Stratemeyer, with whom we are
all acquainted. This last bit of his work is especially good, and the boy who gets
one of these volumes will become very popular among his fellows until the book is
worn threadbare."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Herald.</i></p>

<p>"A good sea-tale for boys is 'The Last Cruise of the Spitfire,' by Edward Stratemeyer.
There is plenty of adventure in it, a shipwreck, a cruise on a raft, and other
stirring perils of the deep."&mdash;<i>Detroit</i> (Mich.) <i>Journal.</i></p>

<p>"In a simple, plain, straightforward manner, Mr. Edward Stratemeyer endeavors
to show his boy readers what persistency, honesty, and willingness to work have
accomplished for his young hero, and his moral is evident. Mr. Stratemeyer is very
earnest and sincere in his portraiture of young character beginning to shape itself to
weather against the future. A book of this sort is calculated to interest boys, to feed
their ambition with hope, and to indicate how they must fortify themselves against
the wiles of vice."&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p></div>
